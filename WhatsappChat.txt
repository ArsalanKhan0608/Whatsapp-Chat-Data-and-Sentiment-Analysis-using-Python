28/12/2017, 23:12 - Beth: 23/12/2017, 23:42:10: ‪+256 701 839948‬: BEWARE. IT'S SNAKE SEASON!!!

DUE TO THE HEATWAVE AND HOT TEMPERATURES, SNAKES, ESPECIALLY COBRAS TEND TO SEEK REFUGE IN COOLER PLACES INSIDE YOUR HOMES.

SAFETY TIPS....

1. Avoid leaving windows open for too long. Cobras and Mambas can reach heights that are very high.

2. Avoid leaving your front doors open for fresh air in the evenings. This reptiles are absolutely STEALTHY (too quiet). You won't hear or see them go inside your house.

3. Before sitting under the tree that has a kind of cooling shade, check the branches that there are no snakes lurking in them.

4. Check your beds and surroundings before you go to bed, cobras are very notorious in hiding under the sheets.

5. Avoid the age old trend of liking to chill outside of the house, with mattresses, mats and wrappers in the evening. Most reptiles are nocturnal (They hunt at night and are very much effective)

6. Not only snakes might bite you, but also the age old human enemy; the centipede (Mosithaphala), which is fast and very venomous.

7. Clear bushes round your houses. They attract rats and mice which are the favourite snacks of the most dangerous snakes favorite meal.

8. Buy snake repellent powder and pour it round your compound. You will definitely decrease the chances of a snake ever visiting your home by 90%.

Beware of confronting snakes that get into your homes. Some snakes can be killed easily, others like the black mamba are very cocky. If threatened,  they will chase you at an alarming speed and give multiple bites while still on the chase; and you might not live to see the next forty minutes. So, just be very careful when trying to kill these snakes. 

Stay well and be safe. It's snake season. It's very hot and they are highly active and get agitated and angry very fast.

This is for your information and safety....#copied

(Always go to your bank personally). 

NEW SCAM ALERT. 
PLS HELP US SPREAD THIS FAST. 
IT MAY SAVE OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILIES, SO RE-BROADCAST. 

Please be aware that fraudsters have developed new software & devised a new means of defrauding people, as the former trick of sending an SMS telling you that your ATM has been deactivated due to system upgrade or BVN issues, is no longer working well for them because people are very much aware of that trick now. 

Their new trick now is to send you an email supposedly, to have been sent by your bank e-mail service informing you that you have been debited #2,000 as *subscription fee* for the bank's monthly digest magazine and the charge will continue every month *(and indeed, any info that you did not request or even requested).* 
To unsubscribe and cancel that monthly deduction from your account, you should click here (a link is given there). 

Once you click the link, it will open up a page where you will be asked to supply your bank details including ATM information. 
That is now the info they need to enable them access and clear your account. 

Please remember: 
DO NOT REPLY SUCH E-MAIL. 
DO NOT CLICK THE LINK TO CANCEL THE MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION. 
JUST IGNORE OR DELETE THE MAIL. 
YOUR ACCOUNT IS SAFE AND NOTHING WAS DEDUCTED FOR ANY MAGAZINE. 

I've done well to alert you. 
Do well to alert more people. 
Above all, don't fall victim. 
It is a fresh and latest information from the security Agencies. 

*Circulate please.*

As the salary reduces you eat products of Chicken (Eggs) and subsequently you begin to eat chicken's food, (maize and millet), and finally, when salary is finished, you become chicken itself, spending your time walking around just looking for what to eat"!_

Salary alone cannot solve all your problems. Choose plan B now.

A wise investment will provide opportunities for one to always eat Chicken whenever he or she pleases!

13/01/2018, 19:19 - Aunt Dora: "There was a bird that lived in the desert, very sick, without feathers, nothing to eat, drink and shelter to live, cursing his life, day and night.

One day, an angel was crossing that desert and the bird stopped the angel and asked him:

- Where are you going?

The angel replied:

- I'm going to meet God.

Then, the bird asked the angel to please ask God when his suffering would end.

The angel said to him:

- Of course, I will do it!

And the angel said goodbye to the bird.

Upon meeting God, the angel shared the bird's message.

The angel told him his pathetic condition and asked when his suffering would end.

God replied:

- During what remains of life, the bird has to suffer like this.

He will not have happiness.

The angel replied that when the bird heard this, it would be discouraged.

So, I ask him if he could suggest a solution for this.

God answered him:

- Tell him to pray this way: * "Thank you God for everything" *

The angel came back to the bird and gave him the message of God.

A week later, the angel again went the same way and saw that the bird was very happy.

The feathers had grown on his body, a small plant grew in the desert area, a small pond of water was also there, and the bird was already singing and dancing happily.

The angel was amazed at how this happened because he remembered that God said that for what was left of life, there would be no happiness for the bird.

With that restlessness in mind, he went to visit God again.

The angel asked and God answered:

- Yes, it was written that there would be no happiness for the bird for what remains of life, but everything changed because the bird is praying daily * "Thank God for everything" *, in each situation.

When the bird fell on the hot sand, it said _ "thank God for everything" _.

When he could not fly, he repeated _ "Thank God for everything" _, so whatever the situation, the bird kept repeating _ "Thank God for everything" _ and therefore changed what was left of life in seven days".

When I heard this story, I felt a huge change in my way of feeling, thinking, accepting and seeing life.

I adopted that prayer in my life.

Whatever the situation I faced, I began to repeat that simple prayer * 'THANK YOU GOD FOR EVERYTHING' *.

It helped me change my view of what I did not have and what I have in my life.

In the same way, I started using this prayer in my life with everything I can relate to.

We share this story with all my family and friends also what brought a great change in their behaviors.

This simple prayer really had a profound impact on my life, I began to feel how blessed I am, how happy I am, how good life is!

It can reshape our life.

A simple word, a simple thought, that teaches us to be grateful for everything we have in our lives, has the power to dissolve any "curse" that we have been carrying all our lives.


_ * Be grateful and you will see the change in your life. * _

_ * Be humble and never have doubts. * _

_*Thanks God for everything...*_

17/01/2018, 22:31 - John Thomas: *I LIVE IN A SHITHOLE*
I have watched with concern how Ugandans and other African Citizens responded to *Mr Trump's* Correct Description of our habitats Africa. My Fellow *Shitholese or Shitholans* don't you see what he said was correct?

*_Few Indicators that we in Uganda are more than Shitholans_*

1-An MP's Salary is more than Healthcare Budget for 1,000,000 Shitholans. _Ugandan General Hospitals get about 200million Ugx per year while a single MP get 340million Ugx per year with regular huge bribe of say 29million etc_

2-Health Centre IV which gets 28million per year is to serve 100,000 Shitholans. Take Arua Municipal with population of about 90,000 gets 28million per year for their Health 10 times what their MP gets.

3-It is only in Uganda that A president does not work for his country but his children and grandchildren. _the same person can say African problem is their leaders who over stay in power. That means M7 in 1986 acknowledged that we are in a *SHITHOLE* which unfortunately he got used to the unpleasant smell of the SHITHOLE to the extend that he sees no reason to call it so_

5-It is only in a SHITHOLE  country that a S.2 Drop out can be an  MP and when he pee in Public he sees nothing wrong with it. Don't you think a place where a MP urinate on the wall of National Ministry of Finance to be a really horrible SHITHOLE?

6-In a shithole is where a Sector like Agriculture which Employs about 80% of the Population gets less than 3% of National Budget.

7-In a SHITHOLE Country like mine a Primary teacher gets 110$ per Month but an MP gets 500$ per day as SDA when he crosses the Country. The same MP then Wanders why his children in Primary seven perform poorly.

8-In a SHITHOLE you will have a Minister who gets treatment in outside country(Both Ministers of Health) daughter of a good President can not give birth in a National Referral Hospitals. 

9-Look around if you have teachers who send their children to study in a private school not the one where he/she teaches. Where you see a Doctor not getting treatment from where he/she works then know that either you are in a shithole or worse place than SHITHOLE.

10-If you have citizens who vote because they received bribe from their leaders then know that you are Shitholan like me. 
 _Ugandans complain when their MPs receive bribe from M7 to lift age limit but they never complain while receiving 2000Ugx each to vote for such an MP. *What goes around comes around* lets enjoy our SHITHOLE Uganda.

I used to hate *Mr Trump* but regrete my actions. We need another *Mr Trump in UK, France, Germany and China*. Cut donation to all these Shitholans who can't even maintain Blood Transfusion Services but steal the money meant to keep their Citizens healthy and alive.

*_Share to all SHITHOLE Citizens like me_*😤😤😤😤haha...forwarded as received..

21/01/2018, 11:03 - John Thomas: WHISPER OF HOPE DEVOTIONAL 

SUNDAY – 21st JANUARY 2018

SCRIPTURE REFERENCE

MATTHEW 6:31-33
“Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you."

REFLECTION 
To worry is to “give way to anxiety or unease; allow one’s mind to dwell on difficulty or trouble.” The word itself comes from the Old English wyrgan, which means to strangle or to seize by the throat. Worry happens when you are so concerned about the problems of life that you can’t think of nothing else. It is an all-consuming feeling of uncertainty and fear. Worry displaces God in your life. When you worry, you are living as though God did not exist, and you are living as though you alone can solve your problems. Worry also distracts you from the things that really matter in life. As long as you are worrying, you can’t do anything else. You are strangled by worry. 

PRAYER
Father today I refuse to be weary in my soul by worrying. I Put my hope and trust in Jesus. It is well with me in Jesus name!

22/01/2018, 05:41 - Aunt Dora: "Entamu yo ewunzikibwa leero" a Luganda word literally meaning that 'You are dying today' said the two men disguised as electricty subcontractor workers as they tried to slit the throat of a defenceless 51-year-old woman in Jjanda Namugongo Zone, Kira Municipality Wakiso District.

Kira Division Police is holding two men for alleged attempted murder CRB:02/2018.
The suspects identified as Ssekiyivu Mohammed and Kibuuka Farouk were tipped off about a woman that had received 150million Uganda shillings the previous day.

The two men disguised as HASO Engeeners Company workers a company located in Kiwatule working as a subcontractor to UMEME  (Uganda's Leading Electricity Distribution Company) entered the premises of one Nasozi
Victoria at around 1:30pm dressed in overalls and requested to inspect the YAKA meter. 

The kids suspected the men were not behaving like electric workers hence decided to follow and monitor them as they inspected the meter. Its at this point that they were ordered to enter the bedroom,locked up and told to say their final prayers

Victoria narrates that one of the men held her by the neck, pulled an axe from the trouser,a cello tape,rope, hit her forehead and began to slit her throat with a small sharp knife

It was at this point as the helpless woman began to cry begging for mercy that the house maid made a loud alarm through the back window attracting help and attention from all the neighbors . 

Police was alerted immediately and swung in saving the men from being lynched by the angry mob.
While calming down the angry mob, DPC Kira Division ASP. Kiribwa Shifah advised the residents to tighten home security by always demanding for identification from the servicemen,always have numbers of the utility area managers and embrace  the Mayumba Kumi System where every one is one another's keeper.

HASO Engineers Company Limited supervisors on visiting the police station could not identify and completely denied the two suspects being their employees.

23/01/2018, 03:05 - Aunt Dora: *Whatever comes your way as you journey into this New Year, remember the lesson of this story...*👇

A little boy and his father visited the country store, and upon leaving the store, the owner of the store offered the little boy some free Sweets... “Get a hand full of Sweets", the merchant said to the boy.
The boy just stood there looking up at his father. The owner repeated himself:- “Son get a hand full of Sweets... it’s free.” Again the boy did not move, continuing to look up in the face of his father.
Finally the father reached into the candy jar and got a hand full of Sweets and gave it to his son.
As they walked back home, the father stopped and asked his son why he did not grab a hand full of the free candy. The boy with a big smile on his face looked into the face of his father and said:- *“Because I know that your HAND is BIGGER than mine.”*

So, whatever your needs are  this year, please place them in the *FATHER'S HAND IN HEAVEN,* because HIS HAND is BIGGER THAN YOURS. 🙏🙏🙏

23/01/2018, 20:54 - Aunt Dora: *UBUNTU* ! *UBUNTU* !! *UBUNTU* !!!
A very nice story from South Africa ...

The motivation behind the Ubuntu culture in South Africa ...

An Anthropologist proposed a game to the South African tribal children ...

He placed a basket of sweets near a tree.

And made the children stand 100 metres away from the tree.

Then he announced that, whoever becomes the first person to reach where the sweets are, would get all the sweets in the basket.

When he said: *on your mark, get set, ready go.......!*

*Do you know what these children did?*

They all held each other's hands and ran together towards the tree. They then shared the sweets equally among themselves, ate the sweets and enjoyed themselves very well.

When the Anthropologist asked them why they did so?, 

They *all* answered *"Ubuntu"*.

Which means:-

*How can one be happy when the others are sad?*

The wife pulled the husband aside and said, "There's no sugar in the house. How can I serve tea?"

The husband winked at her and said, "Make tea without sugar for all. Leave the rest to me."

As soon as the tea was served the husband said to the guests, "Let's play a game of chance. One cup of tea has no sugar. Whoever gets it will take us all for dinner tonight."

The result?

All guests claimed they had never tasted such sweet tea!

01/02/2018, 06:59 - Aunt Dora: The business community in Kampala is still in shock after a man who claimed to be a Turkish investor fleeced them of more than sh2b before he fled the country.
 
Karim Hamoude rented the entire 6th floor of Padre Pio House on plot 32, after that he obtained money and office equipment from at  least 20 local companies, The victims supplied him with a number of new expensive items including laptops, office  furniture, printers, extension cables, scanners, desktop computers and carpets for his new office with a promise to pay them on January 31st but took off via Entebbe airport after selling off all items that were given to him after a week of opening the office. He had hired over 50 employees left them without a pay.

He also tricked a Forex Bureau when he contacted one in town and told them
 he wanted change Uganda shillings into foreign currency, staff of the bureau took Euros 50,000/= (sh229m) and $ 10,000/= to his office last Friday, hopping to get Ug. Shillings. it is alleged that after the Turkish man was handed the foreign currency,he dropped it in a safe and left the office promising to came back after a short call. The Forex bureau employees    waited and waited in vain, the police has since established that there was a hole at the bottom of the safe and the money slipped through to the next room where he picked it and fled to the airport.

He never paid for the apartment he had rented in Muyenga 
 
Ooh Uganda cry my country a lesson to learn here never trust people you hardly know Ugandans fell victims just because this man was white and smart, he had hired only beautiful brown girls in his office and had expensive furniture

01/02/2018, 17:26 - Aunt Dora: PRAYER FOR A NEW MONTH


Dear Heavenly Father I wish to consecrate this new month to you. I wish to walk with you like you did to your beloved friend Enoch so that I may characterize my life with much of your presence.

You began with him when he was at 65 years of age and prolonged his life till he was 365 years of age. Out of your favour he was blessed here on earth and didn’t end up dieing, for you took him to heaven.

It’s a new month today, I invite you to come and begin with me. Prolong my life span so that I may live to witness much of your blessings. Charge me with authority over my life’s situations. Empower me like you did to the twelve that Jesus chose for himself.

Make me a conqueror over all that poses along my path. Free me from any hangovers of last month’s failures. Fill in your blessings on this new page of my life and let me enjoy lots of breakthroughs, opportunities, healing and successes.

Repeat upon me the favours you did to your friend Enoch. I believe it’s not late for you to begin with me. Let me win your favour this month of February.

IN JESUS NAME I PRAY AND BELIEVE

01/02/2018, 19:50 - Aunt Dora: St. Mary's #Kitende last year had over 100 students sit for Makerere University law pre-entry exams but only two scored above 50%. Let that first sink in!!!!😊

(can I continue!?),  OK!! 

So kids from St Mary's Kitende can pass both UCE and UACE exams so perfect with almost all PCB/M guys scoring AAA/A well but will fail pre-entry exams at University yet those who scored DDD/C in rural Schools pass highly yet they did the same exams!? Let that also sink in😃😃

Does this school compound have "miracle knowledge wi-fi" that when you leave u also leave their wisdom behind as well?! Or do the kids over celebrate in vacation and they forget? 
Please don't quarrel am just asking..

*Today i asked my wife for a 20000 to go and drink.* *Truly speaking I'm that one guy who doesn't like bathing.*
*So my wife said she would give me the 20000 on one condition, She said go and bath, i have already run warm water for you in the bathtub.*
*I went there and just applied some Vaseline Petroleum Jelly.* *Without taking a bath and then rushed back to where she was sitting with the kids.*
*I told her i have finished bathing and asked her if she could give me the money so that i could go and have a drink.*
*To my surprise they all started laughing at me and one of my kids said: " Dad you didn't bath because the money is just under the soap".*
*I just left and went straight to bed.*  *I'm still sleeping now because i can't face them*😚😚😚?🙈?🙈🚶🚶🚶🚶🚶

07/02/2018, 09:50 - John Thomas: *For the wheat lovers!!​*

I  am listening to Beth Mugo talking about cancer and I must say our approach towards cancer is what fails us. Beth Mugo continues: 

 "Screening will NOT and cannot lower the cancer cases. Machines and foundations will not stop cancer from spreading! Screening is just getting people who are already sick with cancer. The solution is targeting the people who are NOT sick and teaching them on the way forward so as not to contract cancer.It is senseless to only wait and act on people who are already sick."

Beth is saying that "there are very many people who are going to India. A friend who has been going to India for the last three years because of cancer told me 50%of people in the cancer clinics in India are usually Kenyans. Sadly, many don't make it even after these treatments, this is the bit that we are never told.

The problem in our country is over consuming wheat, animal protein and Sugar. Wheat has a protein called gluten which is the mother of all problems in the immune system. These 3 also aid and encourage the cancer cells to thrive.They also aid the other degenerative diseases especially what i call "the 3 sisters-disease"(diabetes, athritis and high blood pressure) Believe it or not!

I went through the cancer ordeal in 2006, and until I realised I am what I eat,t hat's when I healed. I have seen friends get a diagnosis, go through harsh treatments and eventually die because they only followed conventional medicines. Until and unless we go back to organic foods, fermented foods wimbi porridge for example, natural herbs, there's no end in sight.These are the things that healed me and I have  continued to embrace them as a way of life and that's why cancer has not recurred.
Foundations and screenings are good, but we can do better if we teach people on the harmful products that they are consuming every day leading to the degenerative diseases.

Otherwise waiting for people to get sick in order to get them through  screening so as to treat them is not logical. Someone is benefiting and I can tell you its not the sick person!"

07/02/2018, 21:25 - Aunt Dora: An old church in a village in Brazil was leaking and the walls were almost collapsing, after the service the Padre asked the worshipers if they could organize a fundraising to rebuild the church... He told them to contribute whatever God has blessed each and everyone of them with. If you have some money, you can bring the money,if you earn a living by selling tomatoes in the market, you can bring the tomatoes and they get auctioned to raise the money... If you operate a hardware it would be even better, you can bring some nails and iron sheets for the roof... whatever you have. Eventually, it was the day of fundraising and worshippers came out in large numbers, some with money in their pockets others with goods depending on their jobs and sources of livelihood... They were met by a strange sight; a coffin at the entrance of the church!...Gosh! Who had died?... but then again it was on a Sunday and funeral services were never conducted on Sundays.... What was going on? People started talking in whispers asking what was the meaning of it...they started pointing fingers to an old man seated at a corner; he was the coffin maker...some looked at him in open hostility, but he didn't mind them... the Padre had said that people should bring whatever God has blessed you with, right?... and he was a coffin maker... After the service it was time to raise funds ; those who had money contributed, hardware people gave iron sheets and other building equipments and materials ,tomatoes' traders had brought their tomatoes which were auctioned away... Finally, the coffin maker dragged his coffin to the front of the church and stood still... people gasped and fell silent... you could hear a pin drop . Suddenly an old man, a friend of the coffin maker stood up....he offered 15,000 for the coffin on behalf of the padre... said he was buying it for the padre... The Padre shot up so fast with eyes wide open....his lips suddenly very dry. He quickly offered 20,000 for the coffin on behalf of the leader of CWA (Catholic women Association) The Lady nearly stumbled as she sprang to her feet looking so shocked at seeing her coffin..." No! no! no!" She shouted "it is not mine! ...i ...i...i...will buy it for the Catechist!... 30,000 please!... please! The Catechist nearly peed on himself he turned to look at her angrily as if to ask " do you want to kill me?!" Clearly nobody wanted the coffin and it kept on being passed around until finally another old rich man stood and said that, he is offering 100,000 for the coffin and he is buying it on behalf of the coffin maker... The coffin maker took his coffin and returned it to his shop....smiling. The coffin maker; someone who was looked down upon, someone whom people jeered that he benefits from the misfortunes of others raised the greatest amount of money for the church without contributing even a single coin. You can serve God in many different ways. Perhaps people belittle you until you see yourself as a nobody.....but God want you just the way you are. He will turn your shame into honor.

13/02/2018, 21:51 - Aunt Dora: Something interesting regarding those who believe and those who don't believe in God! Very interesting. It stimulates our lateral thinking.
This lovely parable is from "Your Sacred Self" by Dr. Wayne Dyer.

In a mother’s womb were two babies. One asked the other: “Do you believe in life after delivery?”The other replied, “Why, of course. There has to be something after delivery. Maybe we are here to prepare ourselves for what we will be later.”

“Nonsense” said the first. “There is no life after delivery. What kind of life would that be?”

The second said, “I don’t know, but there will be more light than here. Maybe we will walk with our legs and eat from our mouths. .”

The first replied, “That is absurd. Walking is impossible. And eating with our mouths? Ridiculous! The umbilical cord supplies nutrition and everything we need.”
And moreover if there is life, then why has no one ever come back from there? Delivery is the end of life, and in the after-delivery there is nothing but darkness and silence and oblivion. It takes us nowhere.”

“Well, I don’t know,” said the second, “but certainly we will meet Mother and she will take care of us.”

The first replied “Mother? You actually believe in Mother? That’s laughable. If Mother exists then where is She now?”

The second said, “She is all around us. We are surrounded by her. We are of Her. It is in Her that we live. Without Her this world would not and could not exist.”

Said the first: “Well I don’t see Her, so it is only logical that She doesn’t exist.”

To which the second replied, “Sometimes, when you’re in silence and you focus and listen, you can perceive Her presence, and you can hear Her loving voice, calling down from above.”

May be this was one of the best explanations to the concept of 'GOD' :)
13/02/2018, 21:55 - Lawrence Kibuuka: well explained

*"Destroying any nation does not require the use of atomic bombs or the use of long range missiles. _It only requires lowering the quality of education and allowing cheating in the examinations by the students._"*

Patients die at the hands of such doctors.

Buildings collapse at the hands of such engineers.

Money is lost at the hands of such economists & accountants.

Humanity dies at the hands of such religious scholars.

Justice is lost at the hands of such judges...

*"The collapse of education is the collapse of the nation."*

RIGHTEOUS IDOL WORSHIPPER?

I wondered why I was in the queue of accused at all. I am intelligent, aggressive, young, totally committed to my God. What am I doing here with this sheet of supposed sins in my hand I wondered?

I don’t drink, I don't smoke, I don’t fornicate, I don’t steal, I am righteous. Others should be here not me.

It was finally my turn to face the Man.

I placed my sheet before Him, He glanced at it and sighed softly. He looked at me and calmly said, ‘Guilty of idol worship.'

Imagine my anger, my fury, my indignation. I jumped out of the chair and said ‘Of course not! Check the sheet again, check the name, It can't be mine.’

He sighed again and mentioned one of my names that no one knows.

I would not be stopped. It's impossible’ I yelled. I worship only God, the Most High, Maker of heaven and earth, the King of kings and Lord of lords. I bow down to none, I have no talisman, no amulet, no pot underneath my bed.

‘You are guilty of idol worship’ He repeated calmly.

He looked at me, I looked at Him. It seemed like forever. The room was silent. I could hear the clock ticking.

Then slowly I understood.

I am never late for bus/train station or air flight but I am always late to church - I blinked.

My payments to services I enjoy eg: Dstv, phone bills etc, are never late but I haven’t given offerings/tithes in three months - I looked down.

When meeting one of our local chiefs last week I would not even pick a call in the presence of earthly royalty, but I WhatsApp in church

I wouldn’t interrupt my performance appraisal with my boss for anything but I missed church last week because of a series on TV 

I wouldn’t let a day end without talking to my spouse but today I just said Hi God, Bye God. And I didn’t even pray last night - The room began to feel hot.

I would never miss going to the bank because of the weather but I missed fellowship on Tuesday and Thursday because it was drizzling . 

I would wear my party colors to party meetings and not care what anyone thought of me but I hate to talk to my workmates about God because of what they will think of me. 

I always have the latest tech gadget you can think of but my bible is so worn out. I can’t even find the book of Jude in my bible anymore.

The last thing to touch before going to bed is my phone and the first thing in the morning....chating on whatapp or replying offline messages. And never bordering to talk with God or reading His word.

I felt so hot in the room, a nervous sweat on my forehead, I felt so ill and weak, all of my anger and self-righteousness was gone, leaving immense guilt in its wake.

I slowly got off the chair and knelt by His feet and said ‘I am sorry, I am guilty as charged, Guilty of idol worship, guilty of placing others; humans, technology before You. I am guilty of idol worship.’

He smiled gently, looked at me with those passionate eyes of His full of love and He gave me a fresh sheet!and said, Deliver souls!!

If time would permit u, u can also share or inform others to alert them as I know they are not aware of what they are doing. 

God bless you. LAmen

01/03/2018, 07:40 - Aunt Dora: God hv mercy on us all. Received from someone and shared; 

I was walking around in a Big Bazaar store shopping, when I saw a Cashier talking to a boy couldn't have been more than 5 or 6 years old..

The Cashier said, 'I'm sorry, but you don't have enough money to buy this doll. Then the little boy turned to the cashier and asked: are you sure I don't have enough money?''

The cashier counted his cash once again and replied: ''You know that you don't have enough money to buy the doll, my dear.'' The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand.

Finally, I walked toward him and I asked him who he wished to give this doll to. 'It's the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much . I wanted to Gift her for her BIRTHDAY.

I have to give the doll to my mommy so that she can give it to my sister when she goes there.' His eyes were so sad while saying this. 'My Sister has gone to be with God.. Daddy says that Mommy is going to see God very soon too, so I thought that she could take the doll with her to give it to my sister...''

My heart nearly stopped. The little boy looked up at me and said: 'I told daddy to tell mommy not to go yet. I need her to wait until I come back from the mall.' Then he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing. He then told me 'I want mommy to take my picture with her so my sister won't forget me.' 'I love my mommy and I wish she doesn't have to leave me, but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister.' Then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very quietly..

I quickly reached for my wallet and said to the boy. 'Suppose we check again, just in case you do have enough money for the doll?''

'OK' he said, 'I hope I do have enough.' I added some of my money to his with out him seeing and we started to count it. There was enough for the doll and even some spare money.

The little boy said: 'Thank you God for giving me enough money!'

Then he looked at me and added, 'I asked last night before I went to sleep for God to make sure I had enough money to buy this doll, so that mommy could give It to my sister. He heard me!'' 'I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mommy, but I didn't dare to ask God for too much. But He gave me enough to buy the doll and a white rose. My mommy loves white roses.'

I finished my shopping in a totally different state from when I started. I couldn't get the little boy out of my mind.

Then I remembered a local news paper article two days ago, which mentioned a drunk man in a truck, who hit a car occupied by a young woman and a little girl. The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical state. The family had to decide whether to pull the plug on the life-sustaining machine, because the young woman would not be able to recover from the coma. Was this the family of the little boy?

Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the news paper that the young woman had passed away.. I couldn't stop myself as I bought a bunch of white roses and I went to the funeral home where the body of the young woman was exposed for people to see and make last wishes before her burial.

She was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white rose in her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest. I left the place, teary-eyed, feeling that my life had been changed for ever...

The love that the little boy had for his mother and his sister is still, to this day, hard to imagine. And in a fraction of a second, a drunk driver had taken all this away from him.

Please DO NOT DRINK & DRIVE

The value of a man or woman resides in what he or she gives, not in what they are capable of receiving.
01/03/2018, 09:17 - Kate: 😥 bambi
01/03/2018, 09:26 - Fina: Deep stuff
01/03/2018, 15:38 - Aunt Dora: Hey pipo, as we mourn for susan magara who was kidnapped and found Dead days ago....kidnapping is getting out of control in Uganda especially Kampala... just in case you are the next in the target, try these security measures.

 
1) When going to use a boda you have never used...Take a photo of his ID and send it to the person at your next destination. If the Boda guy has no ID dont rely on the number plate especially at night..there are hundreds of plates out there.
This method keeps the criminal in check if they had intentions to misbehave.
If boda chap hesitates to show ID...run like hell.

2) If you normally arrive home late while driving, avoid parking close to the gate as you wait for it to be opened , it interferes with the attackers plan. Most of the people attacked have no room to reverse back or accelerate forward considering that auto cars have acceleration limitations. Give yourself space where you can use your vehicle as a weapon...depending on the clearance at your gate.

3) The value of your phone gives the boda/Taxi guy an impression that you are loaded... avoid being on the phone during a boda/Taxi ride.

5) Never allow a boda/Taxi guy suggest a route for you in the night. They have crime accomplices planted on the route...

6) If you are using Uber or boda from a party or wherever but going separate ways...use one Uber for the whole stretch to avoid splitting into small vulnerable groups. This ensures safety as any smart criminal guy will be overwhelmed by numbers and by the time of dropping the last individual...you have picked enough clues about the driver. Do step #1 on anyone taking you anywhere...paranoia saves lives...

7) Avoid sitting in the front seat with the chauffer...let him do some work to stop the car and find you behind at least.
8) If a chauffer makes an unscheduled stop, make a call or feign a call and 'report' the incident in a rude way...something like 'This chap is stopping all the time I don't trust him...I think he is a crook...anyway just know I think I am not safe...' criminals especially sexual offenders pretend to be friendly...when you are defensive they back off...
9) Keep a weapon in the driver's side and the passenger's side....your life could be saved by something as small as a screwdriver.

10) Buy and walk with paper spray...it needs no licence like a gun.

11)In an event that your car breaks down in a night travel, never stay inside it, move out to an observation point because it is highly unlikely that anyone except the police will approach the car to inqire what the trouble is. Its easy to fall asleep in the car and become more vulnerable to an attack you have no chance to run away from. You have options when at a distance from the car. You have an option to flee or fight when not enclosed. Staying inside your car could get you killed by a speeding car because of visibility issues.

12) To my friends who have no exposure to guns and blasts...when a an unusual sound rings in the skies...it is not the time to ask mbu what was that...it is time to take cover and cockroach crawl away from where you are...stop screaming and alerting the shooter that you are alive and scared...
13) Never run in a straight line when fleeing bullets...
Stay safe out there....

05/03/2018, 04:45 - Aunt Dora: *Security Information:*

1. Ensure that all security lights are on at night do not compromise security for saving electricity, you would rather spend on UMEME for security lighting than loosing life  

2. Gates should be locked at a specific hour &  no access past that hour.

3. Please avoid moving late in the night whether while at home or Hostel. 

4. Never open for any one before finding out who it is. 

5. The thugs may use a relative's name & voice to dupe you, so make sure that any person who wants to access the house uses a point more visible & preferably the front. 

6. Always keep the phone fully charged with some airtime to communicate with the neighbours or any others person for rescue.

7. Ensure that u communicate your exact movements to at least 2 people and give them contacts of the people in your company or you are hanging out with.

8. It is a good security trick to take photos of the people in your company for example when hanging out and post them say on facebook or whatsapp or to a parent or friends who are not part of the outing, you can even extend to add a short intro say; "attending a wedding meeting with my pals Andrew, Julie, Lisa, Peter, X, Y Z at Javas, so that in the event anything happens to you, post that moment, we may have leads into investigations. 

9. Always be security conscious about people conducting themselves suspiciously around you, u can extend to ask whether the person appearing suspicious to you may need your help, u can politely approach him or her and ask "excuse me, it appears to me that you are looking for some one or is there a way I can help ?"   

10. Be conscious of who is following you if driving for example & if possible try to stop in an area where there are many people & express to them your suspicion. 

11. Avoid riding on Bodas late at night & if you can't avoid it, desist from using a spefic rider all the time since this one can be a future security risk. 

12. Treat most of your phone talk as confidential thus desist from talking on phone while riding on a boda, request caller to allow you time or ask the rider to backup aside to allow you attend to a caller. 

11. Try as much as possible to respond to late night callers, u may be the one to save a life.

May Christ shield us today… Christ with us, Christ before us, Christ behind us, Christ in us Christ beneath us, Christ above us, Christ on our right, Christ on our left, Christ when we lie down, Christ when we sit, Christ when we stand, Christ in the heart of everyone who thinks of us, Christ in the mouth of everyone who speaks of us, Christ in every eye that sees us, Christ in every ear that hears me.

What a joy to know that we can enjoy God's presence in perpetuity.
We can know His presence here and now and throughout all eternity.
We can also take refuge under the shelter of His wings.
No matter what the storms of life may bring, we have a refuge and a shelter in HIM.

PRAYER: Lord, how I long for more of Your presence in my daily life. I choose to live under the shelter of Your wings where I know I will be safe and secure. Amen.

Have a wonderful Wednesday enkya holidaaaaaaay yey!

She finds out that the kid is actually from completely different parents.
Wife: Honey, I have something very serious to tell you.
Husband: What’s up?
Wife: According to DNA test results, this is not our kid
Husband: Well you don’t remember, do you??
When we were leaving the hospital, we noticed that our baby had pissed and spoiled his underwear.
Then you said:
- "Please go change the baby, I’ll wait for you here."
So I went inside, got a clean one and left the dirty one there.

09/03/2018, 06:50 - Joanna: After I retired, my wife insisted that I accompany her on her trips to Walmart. Unfortunately, like most men, I found shopping boring and preferred to get in and get out. Equally unfortunate, my wife is like most women - she loves to browse.

Yesterday my dear wife received the following letter from the local Walmart

Dear Mrs. Woolf,

Over the past six months, your husband has caused quite a commotion in our store. We cannot tolerate this behavior and have been forced to ban both of you from the store. Our complaints against your husband, Mr. Woolf, are listed below and are "documented by our video surveillance cameras":

1. June 15: He took 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in other people's carts when they weren't looking.

2. July 2: Set all the alarm clocks in Housewares to go off at 5-
minute intervals.

3. July 7: He made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the
women's restroom.

4. July 19: Walked up to an employee and told her in an official
voice, 'Code 3 in Housewares. Get on it right away'. This caused the
employee to leave her assigned station and receive a reprimand from her Supervisor that in turn resulted in management getting involved causing management to lose time and costing the company money.

5. August 4: Went to the Service Desk and tried to reserve a bag of
chips.

6. August 14: Moved a 'CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area.

7. August 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told the
children shoppers they could come in if they would bring pillows and
blankets from the bedding department - to which twenty children
obliged.

8. August 23: When a clerk asked if they could help him he began
crying and screamed, 'Why can't you people just leave me alone?'
Emergency Medics were called.

9. September 4: Looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose.

10. September 10: While handling guns in the Sports department, he
asked the clerk where the antidepressants were.

11. October 3: Darted around the Store suspiciously while loudly
humming the ' Mission Impossible' theme.

12. October 6: In the auto department, he practiced his 'Madonna look' by using different sizes of funnels.

13. October 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browsed
through, yelled 'PICK ME! PICK ME!'

14. October 22: When an announcement came over the loud speaker, he assumed the fetal position and screamed 'OH NO! IT'S THOSE VOICES AGAIN!

15. Took a box of condoms to the checkout clerk and asked where the fitting room was.

And last, but not least:

16. October 23: Went into a fitting room, shut the door, waited
awhile, and then yelled very loudly, 'Hey! There's no toilet paper in
here.' One of the Staff passed out.

12/03/2018, 12:12 - Anna Christine: *TRUE STORY.*

Many years ago, on New Year's Day, a very rich man who had no wife, no children, no other family members, decided to invite all the employees of his villa to dinner.
He called the staff and asked them to sit at the table.
In front of everyone, there was a BIBLE and a small sum of MONEY.
After everyone was installed, the man asked:

*"What would you prefer to receive as a gift; this BIBLE or this MONEY?*

Do not be shy, you can choose what you want."

# THE GUARDIAN was the first to react:

"Sir, I would love to receive the Bible, but since I have not learned to read, the money will be more useful to me."

# THE GARDENER was the second to speak:

"Sir, my wife is very sick and that's why I need more money, otherwise I would choose the Bible for sure!" 

# The third was the COOK:

"Sir, I like reading to tell the truth, it's one of the things I like to do, but I work so hard that I never find time to flip through a magazine, let alone the Bible. I will take the money."

# In the end, it is the turn of the boy who takes care of the animals of the villa.
And as the gentleman of the villa knew that the boy's family was very poor, he stepped forward and said:

"Surely you too want the money, do you nit?"
So you can buy food to have a good dinner at home and buy new shoes."

BUT THE BOY,
as was usual with him, surprised everybody with his answer:

"It would not hurt to buy a turkey and other tasty food to share with my parents and siblings, I also need a pair of new shoes because mine are very old.
Even so, I will choose the Bible, I have always wanted one.
My mother taught me that the Word of God is worth more than gold and that it is more tasty than a honeycomb."

After receiving the Bible, the boy immediately puffed it out and found two envelopes inside.

In the first, there was a check that was 10 times higher than the money on the table.
In the second, there was a document that made (whoever would choose the Bible), the heir to the wealth of the rich man!

Faced with the boy's emotion and the astonishment of the other servants, the gentleman opened one of the Bibles and read aloud so that everyone could hear:

*Psalms 19: 7-10:*

The law of the LORD is perfect, it restores the soul;

The testimony of the Lord is true, he makes wise the ignorant.

The ordinances of the LORD are righteous, they rejoice the heart;

The commandments of the Lord are pure, they light up the eyes.

The fear of the Lord is pure, it subsists forever;

The judgments of the Lord are true, they are all just.

 They are more precious than gold, than a lot of fine gold; They are sweeter than honey, than the one that pours rays.

May God give us wisdom and help us always make the right choice.

So what will you do:
To share this story now, delay or simply, ignore?

14/03/2018, 09:02 - Anna Christine: THE STORY BEHIND THE YOUNG BILLIONAIRE, KAZAIRE

Having failed at jobs in the city, he used the UGX 20,000 left as transport back to the village to start doing what made many think he was mad.
A decade later, DR EDWARD KAZAIRE has built a more than 10bn shillings Business Empire out of herbs.

Kazaire Story Starts in GOD

Kazaire’s life was like that of any other ordinary Ugandan youth until he attended the Life in the Spirit Seminar organized by the Catholic Charismatic Renewal while in his first year at the University, in 1999. He recalls, “As we studied the bible, it became clear to me that Jesus’ mission on earth was to announce good news to the poor. And good news was not for them to remain comfortable in their poverty. I realised that God wanted me to be rich for his glory. As we concluded the seminar, we were asked to write letters to Jesus. In mine, I asked for two things: that I may be rich and that I may fully serve Him.”

Sometimes prayers are instantly answered, but other times a person first goes through tests before the testimony can finally come. The later was true for Kazaire. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry in 2002, he hit the streets and walked his shoes out looking for jobs left and right. “I went to Kampala Pharmaceutical Industries wishing to produce tablets but wasn’t given an opportunity. I tried my luck at National Water and Sewerage Corporation and the only available slot was for volunteering. I went to several other places and it was the same story – no jobs.”

Being the first born out of eight children, Kazaire did not have anyone to pamper him; he had to survive on his own. “I decided to turn myself into a self-styled chemistry teacher and taught in three schools. But payment was only after lots of tears at some schools. A cloud of misery surrounded me. Every day that passed, things were getting tougher and rougher. This was surely not the deal I had made with Jesus. In that frustrating moment, I prayed with a brother called Charles Birungi and I felt God asking me to go back home.

Back to the Village Like a Failure

In Ugandan villages, when you are a graduate and return from the city, everyone expects you to come driving and dishing out money like you own the machine that makes it. But Kazaire’s story was different. He miserably returned to Buyanja village, in Rukungiri district, with absolutely nothing – no car, no job, no money.

He went to Ndama Catholic Church to spend some time praying. He narrates, “I needed divine intervention so I could know the next step. As I prayed and listened, I realised I was a chemist but did not know how to translate that into success. I needed to figure out how to make functional what I had learnt in school. I went to the dictionary and found three definitions of a ‘chemist’. The first one was “a person studying chemistry”. The second was “a person who teaches chemistry”. The third was “a person who prepares and sells medicine”. This third one touched me in the right place. I put in three more days of prayer about it.”

Many people get great dreams but only a few turn them into reality. Kazaire had a rich idea, but the question was how to turn it into money. That moment came when he was seated in the house and someone crossed carrying a drum, the kind used to prepare waragi. “Suddenly, I remembered my Senior one chemistry where we learnt about distillation – the process of separating mixtures. As I turned, I looked at a eucalyptus tree and remembered that I had seen people use its leaves to cure cough. I asked myself, instead of people drinking distilled waragi to forget their problems, why not distil medicine and have them cured? I began to collect eucalyptus leaves and did local distillation. I mixed the oil I extracted and concocted a syrup I called NOCOF. People tasted it and got cured. In fact it turned out to be more powerful than any other cough syrup on the market at the time.” Who wouldn’t want such a kind of syrup?

“So after that first formula, next on my agenda was peptic ulcers which I knew to be a chronic disease. I recalled that in Germany some people had used cabbages to treat chronic peptic ulcers. Yet here we ate them as vegetables. In Zimbabwe blackjack was eaten as a vegetable while in Uganda it was used to treat wounds. Since both plants were edible, I knew the issues of safety were covered and since they were both being used as medication, it meant their healing efficacy was also guaranteed. Hence I used the two herbs to create my second formula that started treating stubborn peptic ulcers.”

Until then, in Uganda, herbs were mainly used by Chinese herbal scientists in towns and illiterate local herbalists and witchdoctors who gave herbal medicine a bad image. But here he was, a staunch Christian and a graduate, using herbs to cure disease. Much as it was still at a small scale, he was now sure this was the idea that would turn him into the billionaire he wanted to be, even if no one believed him. So he started spending long hours in the bush collecting all sorts of herbs, a thing that turned him into a subject of mockery, even before villagers who had never seen the light of a blackboard. He confesses he will never forget the day he passed through a trading centre carrying a sack of herbs and heard a lady laughing uncontrollably.“Eager to know what she was laughing at, I turned only to find she was pointing at me. I was so embarrassed. She claimed I had been bewitched. In that same period, many people convinced my parents to take me to Kisizi Hospital for a mental check up.”

Much as he had succeeded in creating effective products, Kazaire had not yet started earning big from them. “I could not manage a big machine for extraction, so I came to the Natural Chemotherapeutics Research Laboratory in Wandegeya; I would give them herbs, they do the extraction and give me the concentrated extract that I would dilute and give to my clients. People who saw me on buses transporting herbs to Kampala believed the rumour that I was really mad. Well, sometimes what the public humiliates and sees as an activity for worthless people is the genuine route to prosperity.”

Going Commercial

I believe the Zimbabwean telecom billionaire, Strive Masiyiwa, when he says that building a big business goes beyond creating a good product and putting it onto the market. He insists that one needs to build the right team, keep benchmarking him/herself against the best in the world, keep thinking and keep innovating. This is exactly what Kazaire did as he found himself in a corner. He had started packing his products and people were now coming to buy only for his father to tell him, “My home is not a clinic; get out.”

“I was already earning about Shs 100,000 per week. So I took a step and established a small clinic near my home and called it Kazire Clinic of Phototherapy.” Word of mouth marketed him like a wildfire. Later, he secured airtime on radio stations such as Voice of Kigezi to share his healthy living message. I remember my own dad was an ardent listener of his radio programs that whenever he went on air, we had to pause anything and everything.

By this time his products were being used in several districts like Kabale, Kisoro, Rukungiri, Ntungamo, Mbarara, Bushenyi and Kanungu. He was slowly becoming an authoritative point of reference for those who wanted to improve their health, to the extent that many people would come to consult him before taking what the medical doctors had prescribed. At one point, to boost his knowledge, Kazaire went to China and did post-graduate studies in dietorytherapy and nutrition. While there, he learnt that the Chinese use herbs a lot and it is one of the reasons they live longer.

Kazaire Today

With unbreakable faith, passion, sweat and prayer, Dr Kazaire has curved for himself a business empire that’s now estimated at over 10 billion shillings, making him one of the youngest billionaires in Ugandan shilling terms and a millionaire in US dollars. He chose the brand name Kazire in honor of his grandfather who once built a big business out of motorcades in the 1960s. His company, Kazire Herbal Products directly employs over 100 people and indirectly over 5,000 people. He owns a gigantic factory that stands in Mbarara town. Though still under construction, it is already functional, producing 800 cartons of juice per day. “I still need 14 billion shillings to make this plant serve the community satisfactorily. When I complete it, it will be able to produce 5,000 cartons a day,” he explains.

The factory produces an array of products. Kazire Orange Tea Drink, which boosts eye sight, empowers the digestive tract in addition to boosting appetite and the immune system, is a natural energy drink that is extracted from oranges, pineapples, carrots, green organic tea and honey. Kazire Lemon Green Tea Drink is extracted from natural and organic lemon, green tea and honey. It is both a stimulant and an antioxidant. It reduces the severity of asthma and bronchitis, lowers blood cholesterol and stops oestrogen from stimulating growth of cancer cells in the ovaries, colon, stomach, lungs, small intestines and other parts of the body. Kazire VIT Fruit Drink is made out of beetroot, hibiscus sabdariffa and honey. It reduces the severity of ulcers, increases blood volume and body cells, and gets rid of headaches and memory loss. Kazire Aloe Green Tea Drink from aloevera, organic green tea, lemon and ginseng clears bone, joint and back pain. It handles constipation and prevents regular fevers. It also helps people with diabetes and hypertension. The factory also produces mineral water under the brand name: Kazire Water.

These products have become so popular that in some places even when planning for a party people have to budget for soda, water and Kazire products. All these products are non-alcoholic and organic as opposed to GMOs (genetically modified organisms). They have been certified by UNBS (Uganda National Bureau of Standards) and are now in most shops and supermarkets in Uganda. In Kampala, they are in Capital Shoppers, Quality Supermarkets, plus several shops in Kikuubo and other places around the city. The company is based in Mbarara, but has a distribution point in Kampala. “When I finish building my factory, I will begin exporting to Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania and South Sudan.” As he says this, the look on his face shows a passionate dreamer who won’t stop until he reaches the top. He says he is still negotiating with Jesus to make him the youngest billionaire on the African continent.

Dr Kazaire has planted most of the raw materials he uses. He owns over 1,300 acres of land where he grows lemons, pineapples, oranges, green tea, aloevera and more than 100 other traditional herbs. Some of the lemons he uses are so rare that he gets them from Arua and Soroti and plans to begin importing them from Tanga in Tanzania. He also has an agreement with Isingiro district local government to supply one million lemon seedlings to farmers in the district freely. The catch is that he holds the right to buy the lemons from the farmers after harvesting.

An Inspiration to Many

If you are looking for inspiration, then Dr Kazaire’s story is a piece of meat that you should chew the way a cow chews the cud. Looking into his eyes, you see a man beaming with a sense of inner satisfaction. His testimony is evidence that there is no river wide enough to cut us from our destiny. All we need is to build a bridge. You and I can build that bridge with creative thinking. “There’s no successful entrepreneur whose major job is not thinking,” Dr Kazaire explains. “Actually I turned an entrepreneur when I was seated, frustrated, thinking of what I should do next, that moment when the sight of a man carrying a drum triggered ideas in my mind.”

Charles Birungi, who prayed with Kazire the day he got the conviction to return to the village, now Senior Economics Advisor with UNAIDS in Kenya, remarks: “I have known Kazaire for the last 14 years. He always strives for excellence, even in little matters. I am not surprised that he has achieved phenomenal excellence in big things.” Peter Karecera, the brain behind Waterfalls Express (Jet Car Wash) and Home Improvements Ltd, says, “Rockefeller triggered an oil revolution, Edson invented a bulb, Kazaire has created health solutions.”

We are living in a conceptual age where it’s no longer physical strength, educational level or family background that matters, but how creative and innovative one is. It’s the extent to which we can create solutions to humanity’s problems that propels us to greatness. In his 30s, Dr Kazaire looks like a youth in 20s. But his small body houses a giant mind and even a bigger heart. Often people come to his factory and upon seeing him they insist their issues can be disclosed only to Mzee Kazaire, unaware it’s him!

Dr Kazire’s products are a master stroke of science and divine power. After production, he prays over them asking God to use them to heal his people. To those who think they can use evil powers to succeed, he warns, “There’s no future for those who practice witchcraft or sacrifice their children to get rich. It always ends badly for them. What we need is divine intervention from God. Without God you will start a business and it fails for no apparent reason. You get money and spend it on a sickness. You get a job and lose it in unclear ways. But the moment we seek God, in the spiritual world we receive and that later manifests in the physical realm. Hence after prayer, we need to continue dreaming about what we have prayed for. You can’t pray for a car and dream about a bicycle. And you won’t dream spending on Champaign before you have saved enough to buy the car.”

According to him, a functioning human being is made up of two parts – the physical and the spiritual, the inner person and the outer person. “I know that the outer me is weak; it suffers sicknesses and can get tired, lazy and bored. It can fail. But the inner me, the Spirit in me, is powerful, gifted, irresistible, courageous, persevering and will always push the outer me to do the right thing. If I want to wake up at 3am the physical me might say, ‘It is still cold; continue hugging your wife,’ but the inner me will insist that it’s time to get up and pray or read a book,” he says amidst laughter.

Dr Kazaire advises everyone who wants to grow their money never to forget to tithe. He remarks, “If you want to keep poor, cheat God. If you don’t tithe, in the spiritual realm you are a debtor and that follows you in the physical realm. That’s why some people get loans but never pay back. If your paper notes, from Shs 50,000 down to Shs 1,000 have never gone to Church to pray and it’s only your coins that pray, you are most likely going to live a life of coins.” Paskazia Tumwesigye, a communication practitioner, testifies, “One of the unique traits about Dr Kazaire is his ability to blend business with faith. One time I listened to him speak about how he had relaxed on tithing the appropriate amount because it felt high only for his income to start crippling until he resumed giving God what is truly His and his business resurrected. From that time on, I started practically giving tithe in its fullness and now I see results.”

“Once you have a dream, start with whatever you have,” advises the accomplished billionaire. “My capital was 20,000 shillings, the transport that took me to the village. Business ideas are everywhere. You can even get one by checking in the trash bins to see what kind of products are commonly used in the area. I call this environmental scanning.”

History will never forget July 1979 when Peter Kazaire and Komushana Olive gave birth to a baby that was to grow into this celebrated industrialist – Dr Edward Kazaire. With all this success, he remains very humble, always praising God together with his wife Tukwasibwe Evas and three boys and one girl that God has blessed them with.

Science says follow logic and consider the facts.Maths say it doesn't add up.Time says it's too late .Age says you're too old.Education says you're not qualified. Experience says you're a novice.People say it's never been done before.The past says check your history .Scars say you're about to get hurt again .Comfort says it is really not worth the trouble? The future says you don't belong here .The pocket says I can't afford it. But faith says," I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." Phillippians 4:13.

21/03/2018, 18:47 - Aunt Dora: SOME THINGS ARE NEVER DONE

1. Never take your parents to court regardless of the value of the property involved. If God wanted you to have that property, you would have been born with it.
2. Never repossess what you once gave a parent. 
3. Never interrogate parents regarding WHAT THEY DID with the last money you gave them. You can find out wisely.  But once you realise it may raise issues, leave it at that.
4. Never lecture parents regarding their apparent weaknesses. You have not outlived them. And you haven't lived long enough. 
5. A parent may take you to court, repossess what he gave you, interrogate you and even lecture you.
6. WISE PEOPLE CAN STAND A PARENT'S SPIT ON THEIR FACES. THEY KNOW IT'S A BLESSING IN 
DISGUISE. 
7. You will never be rich enough to do a parent any favour. All you do for them is a privilege of service. They birthed you but you can never birth them. You simply cannot pay them in kind!!!
8. IF YOU CAN BUY LIFE, THEN YOU CAN LECTURE FATHERS & MOTHERS REGARDING THE HELP YOU HAVE GIVEN them.


9  Parents are treasure on this land and sooner than you think, that treasure will be buried. Appreciate your parents while you still can.
Let's pray today for the beloved parents we have or the ones we have lost. 
🙏🙏🙏

The moment you get out of bed, wash your face, water Company Ltd. National water and sewerage will be reading  their meters. You brush your teeth, Mukwano or Colgate will be earning on you. When you Charge your phone UMEME  will be reading their meter. When you move from your house  to the office, taxi owners,are making money on you .
If u are driving Petrol Station  Owners will be collecting their shares and when you check your WhatsApp, Facebook and other social media, MTN, Orange and Airtel will be making money on you!

So before you get out of the house you have already paid all these companies something. You have already spent money. 
Let's not even talk about the rest of the day. 
So if you are going to bed without making money, how are you going to manage all these bills??

Do something about your life today. 
Start thinking about how to make money everyday. Think Residual Income Start with a small targeted amount and grow as you go. Start with something that will give u even if its 500 Ug shillings a day. Its better than going to bed without making even a 1000 shillings
Let's Put our faith into action, take risks and start something!

SALARY alone can not solve your money problems. You need Secondary Source of income to balance.
SALARY is a MEDICINE for managing POVERTY, it doesn't CURE it. Only your BUSINESS or INVESTMENTS Cures Poverty. 
Be Financially Intelligent... Have a Plan B. This post was sent to me by a friend. I couldn't have it alone. I find it inspirational.

On arriving home, I alighted, paid the Guy and left.

As I approached the gate, I saw the Safe boda Guy following Me.
I quickly changed direction and started moving away from the Gate but the Guy continued following Me. 

I moved faster, the Guy also increased his speed, then I realized I was in shit. 

I ran faster but he kept on following Me, riding even faster. 

I got so tired & decided to stop, turned around, and faced him like a man! 

So I asked him, "Why are you following me?"

The guy replied softly, - " mpa helmet yange (give me my helmet)"

All along I had his helmet on my head!!

Fatigue & stress are a very bad combination ..pheeewww!!

03/05/2018, 01:44 - Aunt Dora: IMPORTANT ADVISE: KIDNAP FOR RANSOM. (This may save you, Do not ignore)

The case of Joan Namazzi (RIP), the student of St. Mark's college, Namagoma who was kidnapped, tortured and murdered as the parents failed to raise the 2 million shillings Ransom demanded for. Even days after, the killers still proceed to call and torment the parents, heartlessly. 

ANALYSIS:

1.The kidnappers had just dumped another body of their victim of about the same age at the same spot a few days earlier. A MUBS student had been killed in the same familiar manner Therefore, it is an operational gang now.

2.They are most likely, an organized but amateur type of criminal serial killers. This implies that they are more likely to kill their victim whether ransom is paid or not.

3.They are most likely operating in taxi parks as touts, especially the old one. They lure victims who apparently may not know their destinations well to another Taxi full of the gang members who then forcefully drive off to their hidden locations.

4.They utilise a victim's phone to contact relatives for ransom, not their own to avoid being traced. Therefore, it is only when you have a mobile phone that you are at a higher risk of being kidnapped. 

5.They are targeting Young ladies only. So far, their suspected victims have all been ladies. 

REMEDIES: To avoid falling a victim or what to do in the event. 

1: Avoid travelling alone at most times especially if you are a lady...in this Uganda of today.

2. Avoid going for "outings" when you do not have somebody you trust with a Car. Boda bodas have been known to "sell" their passengers to these criminal gangs for a commission. I have been a victim of this scenario 3 times.

3. Move only for a DATE or outing with somebody you have known for a while and notify 5 RANDOM people before you go anywhere, even if he is a course mate, classmate, friend etc. Notify, others in Text, whatsapp, facebook posts etc about location, name of your Date etc. And keep updating. 

4.Avoid asking help from men in the Taxi parks. Take your time and search around the park or ask other passengers. 30% of apparent workers in the taxi parks are actually idling crooks.

5.Use your instinct and read posters on Taxis. Why should a Taxi heading to Bweyogerere be parked near a one heading to Nansana?

6. Fathers should endeavour to know the location of their daughters at every particular time whether they are above 30 years and you the daughter should ensure this happens. And I said "father" or male Guardian not mother. There is difference between how a male who loves you would react to these unfortunate events as compared to a female response.

7.Avoid phones for girls under 18 years of age. If you are above 18 and you have a smart phone, ensure that the LOCATION and GPS setting is ON at all times. This can be used to Track your location with utmost accuracy. 

8.Ensure you ALWAYS record and communicate the Number plate of ANY vehicle and Communicate in TEXT to friends or anyone you trust BEFORE you board. (This is cumbersome and boring but when one is kidnapped, it does 80% of the work for Security agencies)

IN CASE YOU ARE KIDNAPPED:

1.Do not be defensive. It is of no use. .Calm down and "play along wisely". Your ultimate goal is to STAY ALIVE as long as possible and showing a rebellious attitude is not a good thing for a Ransom seeker. Remember, he loses nothing by killing you. 

2.Forge "nice-ness". They are still humans. Given a chance, initiate conversation with your keeper. 

3.Do ANYTHING they ask without struggle you and pretend not to be bothered. Remember, your life is more important than ANYTHING at this moment. 

4.Make them have a belief that your relatives have a capacity to pay the ransom even if you are aware that they do not. Give them the confidence that you are "loved" and that sooner or later, the money shall be brought. This will give the security agencies enough time to search before you are harmed. The moment a Ransom seeker loses hope, you are finished. Your life relies on his Hope at this time, so give him a false one. 

IF A LOVED ONE IS KIDNAPPED FOR RANSOM?

1.Report to the nearest Police station. If Police is un bothered, then walk to the nearest Military Facility, RRU, CMI or ISO office they will help. Do not yield to the Kidnapper's threat of "do not tell anyone". Either way, they can't be trusted.

2.NEVER pay the Ransom. It is a gamble. There is actually a 90% likelihood that the victim will be killed whether you pay or not since these are criminal AMATEURS who are not confident about their works and anonymity unlike Criminal gangs in the developed world. They therefore believe that if the victim is let to go, they can be traced. So, if you pay, you may lose both the money and the victim as in the case of the young baby khan #kakama .

4. BUT, Promise them payment of the Ransom. In fact, to be more convincing, "negotiate" it downwards and say for instance, "I don't have the 5 million but I can only afford 3million. Then delay by telling them you need some time to collect it from wherever. This gives them hope.

3.The government is mandated to "arrange" for the "payment" of this Ransom. This is normally one of the best tools by security to capture the criminals so DO NOT jeopardise it by pretending to be Clever. It is not your work, there are people we TRAIN and pay to help us in the event of such misfortunes and you are not one of them. Leave everything for the state to handle. Just forward details as requested. The rest is for God. 

THANKS.

Don't Forget to SHARE and save another.
03/05/2018, 02:12 - Aunt Dora: Hello Ritah Kaggwa, my name is Esther and I have a huge and serious problem. Please help me alert the public about this conman.

It all started in 2015 when i met this guy called #Roy_Kibirige  fb name Roy Kilbridge who happened to be living both in Uganda and London. This guy is a very smart conman who specialized in conning rich women and then after he disappears. The time he met me, i had my own business (a furniture  shop) worth millions of money and i wasn't doing bad at all until he met me . We met at a party and he told me that he was a business man working with General Salim Saleh and also working with state house and some big names in the government under the department of investors. 

He went a head and told me that the president had asked him to return to Uganda and his main job was to bring in investors from America, UK, and Asia. He showed me some Arab friends and told me those were investors from Saudi Arabia and that's when i started to believe him. 

We started to date thinking that i had found the man am gonna build my future with but it wasn't. when i was pregnant for him, he one day came at my house and convinced me to sale off my business on good will so as to facilitate him on some big money project where by he was to bring in the prince of Saudi Arabia for some investment but was stuck and yet we was gonna get 38 million US dollars in return if I facilitate. So I had nothing to do and sold off my furniture business for 96 million Uganda shillings and gave it all to him to finish up his stuck business. 

After sometime I came to realize that all that was lies and lies and yet i had given him all my life's savings and i had sold off my business coz of him. I also came to realize that he had done the same things to alot of rich Ugandan and UK women. Can you imagine some of these women have been chased from their places of work coz they used their bosses money ( eg Sophie who Uses to work at DHL ) and some are in prison ( eg some girl called Carol was arrested in turkey) all coz of him. 

He conns women to facilitate his life style and he moves with a group of thugs he calls his body guards and drivers who help him to make it look like its real he is a big man From state house yet he is a very poor man but likes to live large. He stays in Buziga in a rented apartment being paid for by some sugar momma staying in London called Hajara Nawab who he introduced me to as his sister.

The reason why am asking for your help is to publish him on social media so as every woman rich or not rich should know him. And secondly i want him to take care of his son who he fathered from me and also take responsibility of the other kids he fathered from the other women out there Naye nga tebalina bwogelero.

Attached are his pictures and Copies of the DNA test of my son and him.

03/05/2018, 21:59 - Aunt Dora: *A drunkard woke up one morning deeply repentant after a bitter fight with his wife the previous night. He noticed with dismay the crate of beer bottles that had caused the fight. He took it outside and started smashing the empty bottles one by one onto the wall. He smashed the first bottle swearing... "You are the reason I fight with my wife!" He smashed the second bottle... "You are the reason I don't love my children!" He smashed the third bottle.... "You are the reason I don't have a decent job!"... When he took the fourth bottle, he realized that the bottle was still sealed, full and cold. He hesitated for a moment and said... "You stand aside, I know you were not involved!"*

10/05/2018, 21:33 - Anna Christine: In ancient times, during the month of May it was customary among Catholics to send an image of the Blessed Virgin in a little box that was passed from house to house.
Those who received it were very proud to have it at home.
In memory of this ancient tradition, I send you this prayer to the Virgin Mary to help you should you accept it.
Continuing to forward it to others will be a test of Love, so that the Virgin Mary can travel from house to house, from family to family, from desk to desk.
Her maternal presence will make a difference if she arrives in a place where someone needs it, where she can help to relieve any difficulties.
Our Holy Mother helps the whole world by unburdening our worries, our anguishes. 
As I forward this on to you, please help this prayer to continue its journey, and to bring relief to those who need it, in fact many are in need right now.

* Blesséd is your purity, as it will be for eternity, for God is born afresh through such beauty.*
* To you celestial Queen, Holy Virgin Mary, I offer you this day my soul, my life and my heart, look upon us with compassion, do not leave us O Mother.*
*Holy Daughter of God,*
*Holy Mother of God,*
*Holy Bride of God.*
* I place my heart at your divine feet, Mary, so that you might unite my soul with Jesus.*
* Through your Immaculate Heart, dear Mother, defend us night and day from all faults and sins.*
* Amen.*

Safe travels Our Lady of the Holy Rosary!
Now forward this to all those you desire to bless...

*Father in the Mighty name of Jesus I thank You. I thank You because all power belongs to You. Thank You  because You always answer my prayers. I ask for forgiveness on behalf of our land and  nation Uganda. Forgive us for we have not walked in your ways. I repent for all wickedness, injustice, nepotism, tribalism, hatred, bloodshed, idolatry, and having not given You Your rightful place in our nation. Wherever we have exalted any idol before You, please forgive us, Lord. Father, have mercy. Remember mercy, O Lord. I contend for my country, O Lord. You say, ask of Me for the nations. Lord I ask for the land of Uganda. Remember Your people, Lord, those tossed about, oppressed and trampled upon by situations, hunger and thirst. O Lord, remember mercy and heal our land. Bring the latter rains, O Lord, I pray. Open the flood gates of heaven and let it rain. I plead the blood of Jesus over this land. Let  that Blood that speaks better things than the blood of Abel Raise leaders that are after Your heart, O Lord. Give us leaders chosen by You and let them be vessels to bring this land back to the fear of You, O Lord. Let there be peace and love for one another. Let any power thirsting for the blood of any Ugandan be quenched by the blood of Jesus. I cancel violence in Jesus name. I decree peace, prosperity and blessing to this land. Let peace be upon Uganda, let peace be upon the four corners of this great land. In the mighty name of Jesus I pray. Amen.*
For God and my country.

We are doing a 1,000,000 prayer chain.  Thank you.

19/05/2018, 01:24 - Joanna: Good morning fab family. Our Dearest sweet lovely mutima Jajja Mwami is admitted in Nsambya, private ward. Please keep him in your prayers at every turn. He's better than he was earlier.
19/05/2018, 01:25 - Joanna: Good night. May the Lord heal him.
19/05/2018, 02:41 - Kate: In Jesus' Name Amen.
19/05/2018, 02:41 - Kate: Thanks for update.
19/05/2018, 11:30 - Joanna: Jajja fell down and broke his second leg. Looks like he requires an operation. He's very weak though but much better than his previous self. I strongly recommend each one of us takes a moment to visit him if you can. Even though when you're there it will be please do not disturb. I love you all and love him too. Wish there was more we could collectively do and just be kind a like God.🤔😳🤭
19/05/2018, 11:32 - Fina: Is he still on oxygen??
19/05/2018, 11:32 - Fina: Almost there
19/05/2018, 11:35 - Joanna: Yes he was last night. But he looked like he was in a nice kind of sleep he had not experienced in days. Like a good store. That leg really brought him pain but the meds helped.
19/05/2018, 11:36 - Joanna: Both drip and oxygen

- If you usually put more sugar in your tea when in a hotel than you do at home, You're corrupt. 
- If you use more tissue in a public washroom than you do at home, you are a potential thief if given opportunity.. 
- If you serve yourself more food that you can finish just because someone else is footing the bill, you're greedy. 
- If you usually jump queues, you have potential for abusing office if given a powerful position. 
- If you are more concerned about knowing someone's surname rather than first name, you are tribalistic. Its even worse when someone tells you their name & then u ask, "which tribe is that ?"
- If you usually overlap while in traffic jam or have no regard for traffic lights, then you would easily embezzle public funds if you're given a position at a public office.
- If you channel waste or dirty water from your compound to a neighbour's compound rather than managing it, you're ill-mannered

If you look at this post and wonder whether it was really necessary to talk about these issues; then you are very dishonest and you would easily cover up ills in the society for your own benefit....

23/05/2018, 14:42 - Joanna: Sorry! *False Alarm*
It wasn't a kidnap. CID had set up a corruption net involving a certain government official who was to be arrested upon receiving the money. This official instead sent someone else who was arrested by the officials. Because she dint know who was taking her,she started screaming and people stopped CID officials from arresting her until the DPC jinja Rd came and took her on the police pick up.. The woman was arrested by uniformed Police men and is in custody.

I repent for all wickedness, injustice, nepotism, tribalism, hatred, bloodshed, idolatry, and having not given You Your rightful place in our nation. Wherever we have exalted any idol before You, please forgive us, Lord. Father, have mercy. Remember mercy, O Lord. I contend for my country, O Lord. You say, ask of Me for the nations. Lord I ask for the land of Uganda. Remember Your people, Lord, those tossed about, oppressed and trampled upon by situations, hunger and thirst. O Lord, remember mercy and heal our land. Bring the latter rains, O Lord, I pray. Open the flood gates of heaven and let it rain. I plead the blood of Jesus over this land. Let  that Blood that speaks better things than the blood of Abel Raise leaders that are after Your heart, O Lord. Give us leaders chosen by You and let them be vessels to bring this land back to the fear of You, O Lord. Let there be peace and love for one another. Let any power thirsting for the blood of any Ugandan be quenched by the blood of Jesus. I cancel violence in Jesus name. I decree peace, prosperity and blessing to this land. Let peace be upon Uganda, let peace be upon the four corners of this great land. In the mighty name of Jesus I pray. Amen.*

01/06/2018, 23:43 - Aunt Dora: THE PRICE OF PEACE AND HARMONY IN EVERY MARRIAGE.

Many years ago I listened to a preacher share about how his wife would leave the television on at night and sleep off and they lived in a country where you pay based on how long you keep the TV on. Leaving the TV on therefore increases the television bill.

That attitude of his wife would annoy him and he was always angry at his wife for doing that yet it continued. It was obvious it was going to become a strain in the marriage.

Then one day while ruminating over this issue,I asked myself, “Is your marriage not worth fifty dollars extra at the end of the month? If this attitude of your wife will mean an extra bill of fifty dollars is it too much to pay for peace to be in your marriage?”

Unlike me, my wife is not a morning person. I can wake up by 2:00am, work till 5:00am, go back to bed and still get up by 6:00am and start my day. For my wife, I literally have to drag her out of bed in the morning. Her day begins only after she has had her bath.

In some homes, the wife is the one who goes to the kitchen to heat up water for the family to bathe. I guess it comes naturally with women. In my home, heaven help me if I wait for my wife to do that. I will wait for a long time. So I have resolved to make that my responsibility.

Even with the kids I will still have to be the one doing that in the morning because my wife is not a morning person. If that is the price I have to pay for peace to be in my home, it is worth it. We are talking about the price of peace.

One of my friends shared with me how his wife will never monitor the fuel gauge when driving. It is when the car finally stops that she realizes the car has run out of fuel. Guess who she will call? The husband. He will have to be the one to sort out the problem.

After several of such calls he had to find a way around it. He ensures the fuel tank is full at the beginning of the week which will take the wife through the week. That way he does not get any phone call that the car has stopped. It is the price of peace for him.

When I was working on this article I requested that people share some of the prices they have had to pay to maintain peace in their homes. I got a lot of responses that revealed that no marriage is perfect. The reason we see certain marriages as better than ours is because the parties in those marriages are ready to pay certain prices to maintain peace in their homes.

Let me share a few of the responses I got.

"In my home I just have to tolerate my husband’s attitude. He has this habit of talking over issues repeatedly. He can talk, talk and talk when a situation happens and will nag you till you fall over. So to allow peace what I do is try and keep my mouth shut. No argument, no talking back or simply walk away so that peace can reign."
-Ajoke Mariam Osikoya

"I usually don't turn off the lights in a room when I'm done using it. At the beginning of my marriage hubby will tell me to always make sure I do that when exiting the room, but after correcting me several times without change, he decided to just check back anytime I leave a room and will help turn the lights off. He just stopped complaining and started helping me do it. Eventually, I had to determine in myself to be more aware and I've gotten better doing that.
-Olubunmi Adeleye,

"My wife has a thing for matchsticks. After using one, she keeps it for 'emergency'. This act irritates me. No matter how long we discuss this (more than 9 years now) she still does. So I decided to dispose them and then I offer her a fresh one should an 'emergency' arise." 
-Dapo Shodunke

"I don't pressurize my husband to do or not to do anything, especially something he really wants to, or really doesn't want to do. Putting pressure on him will only irritate him. I keep quiet and I pray instead. That way, I have peace and also get what I want. On the other hand, my husband will always hang the mosquito nets, switch off the lights and unplug my phones, because I always sleep off. He has stopped complaining. He will do the job instead."
-Bisola Muktar Mary

Those were just a few of the several responses I got about the price of peace that people are paying in their homes. A lot of other people were encouraged when they saw that they were not alone. You think you are the only one having an issue until you listen to others.

Sometimes we need to do things we don’t like for the sake of peace. If it is not too high a price then why not just do it and move on with our lives? Not every battle is worth fighting.

That is why it is important to be able to lead yourself because for these people whose reports we just read you find that either they or their spouses took responsibility for peace. That is part of what personal leadership is about.

I could have picked a fight with my wife for refusing to get up from the bed in the morning. Hamzah could have picked a fight with his wife for that thing with the matchsticks. Fatimah’s husband could have picked a fight with her for always forgetting to turn off the lights. But personal leadership helped us to take the other route thereby maintaining peace in our homes.

Now this does not mean you will never have to correct each other in the relationship or continually be in endurance mode throughout the marriage especially when it has to do with abuse. That is a completely different matter. You don’t endure abuse. But instead of fighting over why your spouse always presses the toothpaste tube from the middle, why not buy a second one so you have yours and he has his and both of you have peace? Has that not solved the problem?

03/06/2018, 03:52 - Aunt Dora: WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU HAVE A TYRE BLOWOUT WHILE STILL IN MOTION (SPEED)

In the event of the unfortunate death of Nigeria's minister of state for labour due to an accident occasioned by a tyre blowout and sometime ago and the fact that we have many untrained drivers, it has become pertinent for me to write this.

There are 6 simple steps to take within a maximum of 2 minutes and you will be safe, these by the grace of God I have been familiar with for decades. They are as follow:

(1) DON'T PANIC in the event of a blowout, calm yourself down fast because your car will start misbehaving and you need to take charge.   

(2) Hold FIRMLY to your steering wheel with both hand, NO VIGOROUS TURNING, as you concentrate on the road and your mirrors, in seconds study the movement pattern of the car. Your car will naturally swerve to the direction of the burst tyre. 

(3) Gradually take off your foot from the accelerator, DON'T EVER ATTEMPT TO PRESS THE BRAKES, IF YOU DO, YOU HAVE A 95% CHANCE OF A SOMERSAULT. The car will decelerate gradually while you concentrate on the road to avoid collision with any other road user. 

(4) Disengage the gears of the car by shifting to neutral (N) as you still maintain a firm grip on the steering wheel and put your eyes on the road.

(5) After a while depending on your initial speed, your car comes to a speed less than 60km/h when it is now safe to GRADUALLY apply the brakes and navigate to the side walk 

(6) Ultimately, it is now safe to put the car to a complete stop and turn off the engine. You have just saved yourself and passengers from untimely death.

NOTE:
Of course, everyone in the car will be in a panic mode BUT this is NOT THE TIME TO LISTEN TO THEM, it is TIME TO CONCENTRATE.

Please, don't just read share on your page and copy to other platforms, you may just be about to save a life.
I pray that God will continue to keep us safe as we use the roads.

Dear Colleagues,

Below is a report of a security incident that happened in Kampala and was circulated on a security group that I am a member of. I am sharing this information with you due to the seriousness of the incident, so that you may keep yourselves and your loved ones safe.

“There must really be something sinister going on... A friend of mine underwent a similar experience on the 27th of April this year... This is his story....he was in kireka that night, so by 10pm, he decided to leave for home, he went to a supermarket just opposite that shell in kireka, to buy radio cells.. Right outside the supermarket, he sees a taxi hailing for passengers heading to namugongo and sonde, he jumped into the taxi since he is a resident of namugongo.. Shortly, a lady also comes out of the same supermarket and boards the same taxi.. They set off.. For those of you who are familiar with the kireka namugongo road, there is a junction, ideally the taxi, should have turned off to the right from kyaliwajala, but the driver rushed towards Kira.. Naturally someone had to complain.. It's on that note that the driver increased the speed, amid their protests, 4 "passengers" pulled out military grade benets, very long ones... And one of them ordered the passengers not to make any noise lest they are killed.. My friend says he peed in his pants... The thugs stopped the taxi in that first swamp just after Kira on Kira kasangati road.. They were told to disembark carefully.. It's when he realized that they were only 5 genuine passengers, 1 woman and 4 men, they sat them down and the 4 men were tied in pairs, bound by the legs with a wire.. (he showed us that scar as a result of the wire).. The scar was caused by the wire on his uncle.. After the men were secured... Guess what happened to the woman.. All the 5 Goons did the unthinkable to her... Used her terribly.. One of the bound me was so shocked that he tried to flee.. He was stabbed in the neck... Now the thugs asked for money.. They first came to this friend if mine.. He told them that he had no money.. They hit him with an iron bar on the head, he bled profusely... That is when he decided to release the 35k he was keeping in his socks... The young boy he was bound with told the thugs that he is an orphan who only had the taxi fare on him, the boy looked like he was in O level... The thugs were furious and said the kid was a "kisiranii".. The got hold of his ear and cut it off... Yes cut the young lads ear off.... Now this scared my friend, he is also attempted to ran away, only to receive a Benet stab in his shoulder.. (he has a massive scar)... After these guys were done with them, the driver jumped into the taxi.. After about 1 hour, he came back with another set of victims, but they were placed at a distance from them, so they he couldn't decipher how many women or men were there..... This is how he was released... He and the boy whose ear was chopped off were told to get up and walk with a warning of being killed if any of them looked behind.. They walked for over a kilometer, but he sensed at one point that no one was following him, so he looked behind, and truly, there was no one... Since it was late, about 3am, he went home, he only got first aid around 7am, reported at namugongo police station at the Anglican shrine... The doctor told him to watch out for a brain clot manifesting as a bleeding nose as a result of the iron bar injury.. Unfortunately he got a nose bleed two weeks ago.. He is yet to get money for further analysis...he says the thugs were constantly on phone speaking a mixture of kiswahili and a western uganda dialect. He had a feeling that they were rebels... Forgive the typos Grammar errors.. They were not intended because of the long nature of the post.. So please let's be careful.. Something wrong is going on”

As you can see from the above narrative, the incident is quite worrying. I caution you all to be extra cautious about your personal safety especially when using taxis late at night.

07/06/2018, 11:55 - Tina, Kerbi: *Your Wife Is Your Wife*
A married couple was walking through a garden, suddenly a dog ran towards them.
They both knew it will bite them...
The husband lifted his wife to let the dog bite him rather than his sweetheart.
The dog stopped before them, unsure what to do, barked a little and ran away.
The husband put his wife down, expecting a hug and a few kind words of gratitude from her.
But his wife shouted "I've seen people throwing stones & sticks at dogs, this is the first time I see someone trying to throw his wife at a dog"

Moral: A Wife is a Wife 

"No One ELSE Can MIS-UNDERSTAND a Husband Better, than a Wife."

Husband it is well. Take heart it is part of the challenges of being a husband.

HAPPY WORLDS HUSBAND DAY💁🏼‍♂...!

09/06/2018, 23:43 - Aunt Dora: BETTY BAKIREKE NAMBOOZE 

One great writer  said that, to the living we owe respect, but to the dead we owe only the truth but when death comes more so abruptly and in such a gruesome manner like it happened to my Honourable brother Col.Ibrahim Abiriga, truth ceases to matter but the fact that a life is lost. 

I would therefore on my own behalf and on behalf of the people of Mukono Municipality  wish to express our condolences to his family, relatives and to the people of Arua Municipality  for this gruesome assisination that only adds to the trauma we are already suffering as a country over unexplained murders.

Am however, not going to insult Abiriga's memory by pretending that  he was my freind. He was far from it....He wasn't shy about expressing his opinion....which I highly doubt was his opinion,to me he was a loud speaker for the people who have chosen to love  power more than  the future of our Uganda. He knew how to offend and irritate those of us who find Museveni's Government a curse to our country. He is one of the politicians who  really bastardised the politics of this country.  As other people were being murdered including fellow Moslems,  Abiriga clapped loudest that there should be no change...he invested all himself to maintain the status quo and it's within this status quo that he has perished. 
 
When one day I ran towards him to grab his yellow cap at Parliament,my intention was to show him that even with the guards the regime was fooling him with,it couldn't secure him fully. For that act and another of grabbing Pecos Kuteesa's military cap, I paid with my backbone. Am now maimed for life and when I returned to Parliament after hospitalisation Abiriga tried to mock me, For which I almost physically  fought with him. 

But when news of Abiriga's assisanation came, I went cold with pain...I cried tears, but deep inside I knew I wasn't crying for Abiriga, he was gone, I was crying for my country..... We need our colleagues like Abiriga to stay around to realise the mess we have sunk our country in and maybe join forces to dig it out of the pit. We need to reject any politics that targets people because of their political beliefs. This isn't a matter of political correctness. It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong. Uganda will be better not  through elimination of those we don't agree with or innocent people to traumatise the Nation but because of our effort to put up systems that will work for us all irrespective of our political  beliefs.  Every life must be respected and every murder must be condemned.

As we bury Abiriga, leaving his young family without a provider,it high time we all raise in one voice to say that the status quo is hopeless, there are no winners in a sinking boat IT TIME TO CHANGE even when Museveni still insists that those terrorising us are idiots we must come out boldly to tell him that we have no use with a Regime and a President who cannot successfully  deal with "idiots". Rest in peace Abiriga.

10/06/2018, 07:28 - Aunt Dora: Two Choices

What would you do?....you make the choice. Don't look for a punch line, there isn't one. Read it anyway. My question is: Would you have made the same choice?

At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves children with learning disabilities, the father of one of the students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended.

After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he offered a question:

'When not interfered with by outside influences, everything nature does is done with perfection.

Yet my son, Shay, cannot learn things as other children do. He cannot understand things as other children do.

Where is the natural order of things in my son?'

The audience was stilled by the query.

The father continued. 'I believe that when a child like Shay, who was mentally and physically disabled comes into the world, an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself, and it comes in the way other people treat that child.'

 Then he told the following story:

Shay and I had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball. Shay asked, 'Do you think they'll let me play?' I knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team but as a father

 I also understood that if my son were allowed to play, it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging and some confidence to be accepted by others in spite of his handicaps.

I approached one of the boys on the field and asked (not expecting much) if Shay could play. The boy looked around for guidance and said, 'We're losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning.

I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning.'

Shay struggled over to the team's bench and, with a broad smile, put on a team shirt. I watched with a small tear in my eye and warmth in my heart. 
The boys saw my joy at my son being accepted.

In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was still behind by three the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the right field..

Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously ecstatic just to be in the game and on the field, grinning from ear to ear as I waved to him from the stands.

In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again Now, with two outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat.

At this juncture, do they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game?

Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat properly, much less connect with the ball.

However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher, recognizing that the other team was putting winning aside for this moment in Shay's life, moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least make contact.

The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly towards Shay.

As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher.

The game would now be over. The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman.  Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game.

Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the first baseman's head, out of reach of all team mates.

Everyone from the stands and both teams started yelling, 'Shay, run to first! Run to first!'

Never in his life had Shay ever run that far, but he made it to first base. He scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled.

Everyone yelled, 'Run to second, run to second!' Catching his breath, Shay awkwardly ran towards second, gleaming and struggling to make it to the base.

By the time Shay rounded towards second base, the right fielder had the ball. The smallest guy on their team who now had his first chance to be the hero for his team.

He could have thrown the ball to the second-baseman for the tag, but he understood the pitcher's intentions so he, too, intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third-baseman's head.

Shay ran toward third base deliriously as the runners ahead of him circled the bases toward home.

All were screaming, 'Shay, Shay, Shay, all the Way Shay'

Shay reached third base because the opposing shortstop ran to help him by turning him in the direction of third base, and shouted, 'Run to third! Shay, run to third!'

As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams, and the spectators, were on their feet screaming, 'Shay, run home! Run home!'

Shay ran to home, stepped on the plate, and was cheered as the hero who hit the grand slam and won the game for his team.

 "That day', said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face, 'the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world'.

Shay didn't make it to another summer. He died that winter, having never forgotten being the hero and making me so happy, and coming home and seeing his mother tearfully embrace her little hero of the day!

 

AND NOW A LITTLE FOOT NOTE TO THIS STORY:

We all send thousands of jokes through the e-mail without a second thought, but when it comes to sending messages about life choices, people hesitate.

The crude, vulgar, and often obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion about decency is too often suppressed in our schools and workplaces.

If you're thinking about forwarding this message, chances are that you're probably sorting out the people in your address book who aren't the 'appropriate' ones to receive this type of message Well, the person who sent you this believes that we all can make a difference.

We all have thousands of opportunities every single day to help realize the 'natural order of things.'

So many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us with a choice:

Do we pass along a little spark of love and humanity or do we pass up those opportunities and leave the world a little bit colder in the process?

A wise man once said every society is judged by how it treats its least fortunate amongst them.


May your day, be a Shay Day.

12/06/2018, 22:43 - Joanna: Hi everyone. Grandpa's unwell he has a fractured right hip born since  Oct 8, 2017 and a broken left hip born since May 18th 2018.  Although he has improved and is off oxygen, eating a bit and is back home in Rubaga,  he requires daily nursing. This means a fee equivalent to 1,800,000/= per month without meds. His immediate children our parents have done their best but its becoming more and more challenging by the day. The next deposit for the nursing is due on the 28th of June and this is a plea for help.

We can make individual discretionary contributions to this by sending anything you can to me through mobile money 0772659191 with reason Grandpa Nursing or onto my Stanbic account Joan Ntabadde held at Nakasero Branch 9030010354179 and I will consolidate it into a lumpsum generation contribution. The narrative if on account can be your name and I'll know it's purpose. I will share and acknowledge receipt of all contributions and keep you and the first generation updated of where we stand.  
I have not referred to jajjas account so that we don't mix the purpose of the funds with other matters arising etc. Ofcourse other suggestions are welcome.

You are all dears and are always very much appreciated, only do contribute if you can and any amount you can.  Blessings

16/06/2018, 19:01 - Lena: And to you as well!!
16/06/2018, 19:07 - Joanna: Okay the medics ie Solome and others have advised that he is not able to walk as the recovery process is a bit different. Our mwami, grand father couldn't be operated  so we are letting nature take its course which means it takes 6-12 weeks for a fracture to unite so in this case the leg can't be moved; therapy is there to try to improve blood circulation; reduce blood clots, maintain  muscle bulk. This is where we have a nurse to support his recovery therapy and meds.
16/06/2018, 19:08 - Tina, Kerbi: That makes another of sense now... Tx
16/06/2018, 19:08 - Joanna: I think the above explanation can help with the purpose of the fund collection for the nurse.

17/06/2018, 18:41 - Aunt Dora: *WHEN YOU DIE*
When you die, don't worry.
Don't be concerned over your decaying body because people will take care of what is required.

*They will..
*1 - Buy you new white clothes
*2 - Wash you
*3 - Take you out of your home 
*4 - to your new place of stay (the grave)
*5 - Many will come to bid farewell at your funeral - in fact, many will cancel work for the sake of your burial, even though most of them didn't know you whilst you were alive.
*6 - Your belongings will be gotten rid of:
* your cars
* your check books
* your bags
* your shoes
* your clothes
* Your job, someone else will take your position*
* Your wealth will go to inheritors
* Whereas you will remain to be questioned about every minor and major deed
* There will be 3 types of mourners over you
* 1- The people who knew you only at face value will say 'poor man'
* 2- Your friends will grieve for hours or days but then return to laughter
* 3- The deep grief at your household will last for a week, two weeks, a month, 2-months or even a year

* And thereafter they will add you to their memories
* And so your story amidst the people ended
* And your story with the reality begins, *where will you spend Eternity?*
* And that is the life after death
* Indeed, the following things will leave you:-
* 1- Beauty
* 2- Wealth
* 3- Health
* 4- Children
* 5- The mansions
* 6- Your spouse
* And your real life has just started, *Eternity*.

The question here is....
*What have you prepared for your Eternity or hereafter?*
This reality needs to be thought over: Therefore 
*Take care of these two things ..*
*1- Salvation*
*2- Sanctification*
Don't forget your *Prayers*
Because once your  eyes closes in death, the only property left for you is *"your relationship  WITH GOD".*  
Where will you spend Eternity, *Heaven or Hell.* Let's all live a *holy life* my Brothers & sisters.

Pope  Francis has only one lungs because the other has been removed due to infections. He needs more of our prayers than ever. We ask all Catholics and non Catholics all over the world to pray for Pope Francis so that he can continue his reforms and helping the poor as the leader of humanity. 
Our goal is to reach ten  million Hail Mary for Pope. The campaign has just began. Share this message to 5 groups in order to support Pope Francis' work. Hail Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is with you. You are blessed among women and Jesus the fruit of your womb is blessed. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us poor sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
Don't forget to share to help us reach our goal of  10miillion Holy Mary. 
We can achieve it.

*AVOID EATING DEADLY CHICKEN BONES*
*PLEASE IF YOU DECIDE TO DIE, DIE OF ANYTHING BUT IGNORANCE*
*STOP CHEWING CHICKEN BONES BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE POISON LIES IN THE BONE*

Avoid eating chicken wings frequently - ladies, especially; 
*a true story*...!
A friend of mine recently had a growth in her womb and she underwent an *operation to remove the…. The cyst removed was filled with dark colored blood.* She thought that she would recover after the surgery but! She was terribly wrong.

A relapse occurred just a few months later. Distressed, she rushed down to her gynecologist for a consultation.
During her consultation, *her doctor asked her a question that puzzled her. He asked if she was a frequent consumer of chicken wings and she replied yes wondering as to how he knew of her eating habits.* You see, the truth is in this modern day and age; *chickens are injected with steroids to accelerate their growth so that the needs of this society can be met.*

This need is none other than the need for food. 

*Chickens that are injected with steroids are usually given the shot at the neck or the wings.*
Therefore, it is *in these places that the highest concentration of steroids exists.* These steroids have terrifying effects on the body as it accelerates growth..

*It has an even more dangerous effect in the presence of female hormones, this leads to women being more prone to the growth of a cyst in the womb.*

Therefore, I advise the people out there to watch their diets and to lower their frequency of consuming chicken wings!

People, who receive this message *please forward it to your friends and loved ones.* I am sure no one wants to see him or her suffer!😳😰💦

23/06/2018, 18:51 - Aunt Dora: Someone asked Bill Gates, Is there any person richer than you?

He said, yes, only one. Many years ago, I had been dismissed and I had gone to New York airport. I read titles of newspapers there. I liked one of them and I want to buy it. But I didn't have change (coin). So abandoned the idea, suddenly, a black boy called me and told me, “This newspaper for you.” I said, but I don’t have change. He said, “No problem, I give you free”.

After 3 months, I went there. Coincidentally, that story happened again and that same boy gave me another free newspaper again. I said, I can’t accept it. But he said, “I give you from my profit.”

After 19 years, I had been rich and I decided to find that boy. I found him after one and half month's search. I asked him, do you know me? He said, “Yes, you’re famous Bill Gates.”

I said, you gave me free newspaper 2 times many years ago. Now, I want to compensate it. I am going to give you everything that you want. Black young man replied, “You can’t compensate it!”
I said, why? He said, "Because I gave you when I was poor. You want to give me when you are rich. So, how do you compensate?"

Bill Gates said, I think that black young man is richer than me.

You don't have to be rich or wait to be rich to give......

*Real attitude of giving is when you lack*

Keep the Spirit Alive

BY ROMELU LUKAKU
JUN 18 2018

I remember the exact moment I knew we were broke. I can still picture my mum at the refrigerator and the look on her face.

I was six years old, and I came home for lunch during our break at school. My mum had the same thing on the menu every single day: Bread and milk. When you’re a kid, you don’t even think about it. But I guess that’s what we could afford.

Then this one day I came home, and I walked into the kitchen, and I saw my mum at the refrigerator with the box of milk, like normal. But this time she was mixing something in with it. She was shaking it all up, you know? I didn’t understand what was going on. Then she brought my lunch over to me, and she was smiling like everything was cool. But I realized right away what was going on.

She was mixing water in with the milk. We didn’t have enough money to make it last the whole week. We were broke. Not just poor, but broke.

My father had been a pro footballer, but he was at the end of his career and the money was all gone. The first thing to go was the cable TV. No more football. No more Match of the Day. No signal.

Then I’d come home at night and the lights would be shut off. No electricity for two, three weeks at a time. Then I’d want to take a bath, and there would be no hot water. My mum would heat up a kettle on the stove, and I’d stand in the shower splashing the warm water on top of my head with a cup.

There were even times when my mum had to “borrow” bread from the bakery down the street. The bakers knew me and my little brother, so they’d let her take a loaf of bread on Monday and pay them back on Friday.

I knew we were struggling. But when she was mixing in water with the milk, I realized it was over, you know what I mean? This was our life.

I didn’t say a word. I didn’t want her to stress. I just ate my lunch. But I swear to God, I made a promise to myself that day. It was like somebody snapped their fingers and woke me up. I knew exactly what I had to do, and what I was going to do.

I couldn’t see my mother living like that. Nah, nah, nah. I couldn’t have that.

People in football love to talk about mental strength. Well, I’m the strongest dude you’re ever going to meet. Because I remember sitting in the dark with my brother and my mom, saying our prayers, and thinking, believing, knowing … it’s going to happen.

I kept my promise to myself for a while. But then some days I’d come home from school and find my mum crying. So I finally told her one day, “Mum, it’s gonna change. You’ll see. I’m going to play football for Anderlecht, and it’s going to happen soon. We’ll be good. You won’t have to worry anymore.”

I was six.

I asked my father, “When can you start playing professional football?”

He said, “Sixteen.”

I said, “O.K., sixteen then.”

It was going to happen. Period.

Let me tell you something — every game I ever played was a Final. When I played in the park, it was a Final. When I played during break in kindergarten, it was a Final. I’m dead-ass serious. I used to try to tear the cover off the ball every time I shot it. Full power. We weren’t hitting R1, bro. No finesse shot. I didn’t have the new FIFA. I didn’t have a Playstation. I wasn’t playing around. I was trying to kill you.

When I started growing taller, some of the teachers and the parents would be stressing me. I’ll never forget the first time I heard one of the adults say, “Hey, how old are you? What year were you born?”

I’m like, What? Are you serious?

When I was 11 years old, I was playing for the Lièrse youth team, and one of the parents from the other team literally tried to stop me from going on the pitch. He was like, “How old is this kid? Where is his I.D.? Where is he from?”

I thought, Where am I from? What? I was born in Antwerp. I’m from Belgium.

My dad wasn’t there, because he didn’t have a car to drive to my away games. I was all alone, and I had to stand up for myself. I went and got my I.D. from my bag and showed it to all the parents, and they were passing it around inspecting it, and I remember the blood just rushing through me … and I thought, “Oh, I’m gonna kill your son even more now. I was already going to kill him, but now I’m gonna destroy him. You’re gonna drive the boy home crying now.”

I wanted to be the best footballer in Belgian history. That was my goal. Not good. Not great. The best. I played with so much anger, because of a lot of things … because of the rats running around in our apartment … because I couldn’t watch the Champions League … because of how the other parents used to look at me.

I was on a mission.

When I was 12, I scored 76 goals in 34 games.

I scored them all wearing my dad’s shoes. Once our feet got to be the same size, we used to share.

One day I called up my grandfather — my mum’s dad. He was one of the most important people in my life. He was my connection back to Congo, where my mum and dad are from. So I was on the phone with him one day, and I said, “Yeah, I’m doing really well. I scored 76 goals, and we won the league. The big teams are noticing me.”

And usually, he always wanted to hear about my football. But this time it was strange. He said, “Yeah, Rom. Yeah, that’s great. But can you do me a favor?”

I said, “Yeah, what is it?”

He said, “Can you look after my daughter, please?”

I remember being so confused. Like, what’s Grandad on about?

I said, “Mum? Yeah, we’re cool. We’re O.K.”

He said, “No, promise me. Can you promise me? Just look after my daughter. Just look after her for me, O.K.?”

I said, “Yeah, Granddad. I got it. I promise you.”

Five days later he passed away. And then I understood what he really meant.

It makes me so sad to think about, because I just wish that he could have lived another four years to see me play for Anderlecht. To see that I kept my promise, you know? To see that everything was going to be O.K.

I told my mum that I would make it at 16.

I was late by 11 days.

May 24, 2009.

The playoff final. Anderlecht vs. Standard Liège.

That was the craziest day of my life. But we have to back up for a minute. Because at the start of the season, I was barely playing for the Anderlecht U-19s. The coach had me coming off the bench. I’m like, “How the hell am I going to sign a pro contract on my 16th birthday if I’m still on the bench for the U-19s?”

So I made a bet with our coach.

I told him, “I’ll guarantee you something. If you actually play me, I’m going to score 25 goals by December.”

He laughed. He literally laughed at me.

I said, “Let’s make a bet then.”

He said, “O.K., but if you don’t score 25 by December, you’re going to the bench.”

I said, “Fine, but if I win, you’re going to clean all the minivans that take the players home from training.”
He said, “O.K., it’s a deal.”

I said, “And one more thing. You have to make pancakes for us every day.”

He said, “O.K., fine.”

That was the dumbest bet that man ever made.

I had 25 by November. We were eating pancakes before Christmas, bro.

Let that be a lesson. You don’t play around with a boy who’s hungry!

I signed my pro contract with Anderlecht on my birthday, May 13. Went straight out and bought the new FIFA and a cable package. It was already the end of the season, so I was at home chilling. But the Belgian league was crazy that year, because Anderlecht and Standard Liege had finished tied on points. So there was a two-leg playoff to decide the title.

During the first leg, I’m at home watching on TV like a fan.

Then the day before the second leg, I get a phone call from the coach of the reserves.

“Hello?”

“Hello, Rom. What are you doing?”

“About to go play football in the park.”

“No, no, no, no, no. Pack your bags. Right now.”

“What? What did I do?”

“No, no, no. You need to get to the stadium right now. The first team wants you now.”

“Yo …. What?! Me?!”

“Yeah, you. Come now.”

I literally sprinted into my dad’s bedroom and was like, “Yo! Get your ass up right now! We gotta go, man!”

He’s like, “Huh? What? Go where?”

I’m like, “ANDERLECHT, MAN.”

I’ll never forget, I showed up to the stadium, and I like pretty much ran into the dressing room and the kitman said, “O.K., kid, what number do you want?”

And I said, “Give me number 10.”
The kitman said, “O.K., kid, what number do you want?” And I said, “Give me number 10.”
Hahahaha! I don’t know. I was too young to be scared I guess.

He was like, “Academy players have to take 30 and above.”

I said, “O.K., well, three plus six equals nine, and that’s a cool number, so give me 36.”

That night at the hotel, the senior players made me sing a song for them at dinner. I can’t even remember what I picked. My head was spinning.

The next morning, my friend literally knocked on the door of my house to see if I wanted to play football and my mum was like, “He’s out playing.” 

My friend said, “Playing where?”

She said, “The final.”

We got off the bus at the stadium, and every single player walked in wearing a cool suit. Except me. I came off the bus wearing a terrible tracksuit, and all the TV cameras were right in my face. The walk to the locker room was like 300 meters. Maybe a three-minute walk. As soon as I put my foot in the locker room, my phone starts blowing up. Everybody had seen me on TV. I had 25 messages in three minutes. My friends were going crazy.

“Bro?! WHY ARE YOU AT THE GAME?!”

“Rom, what is happening? WHY ARE YOU ON TV?”

The only person I texted back was my best friend. I said, “Bro, I don’t know if I’m gonna play. I don’t know what’s going on. But just keep watching the TV.”

In the 63rd minute, the manager subbed me on.

I ran out onto the field for Anderlecht at 16 years and 11 days old.

We lost the final that day, but I was already in heaven. I made good on my promise to my mother and to my grandad. That was the moment I knew we were gonna be O.K.

The next season, I was still finishing up my last year of high school and playing in the Europa League at the same time. I used to have to take a big bag to school so I could catch a flight in the afternoon. We won the league by a mile, and I finished second for African Player of the Year. It was just … crazy.

I actually expected all that to happen, but maybe not so fast. All of sudden, the media was building me up, and putting all these expectations on me. Especially with the national team. For whatever reason, I just wasn’t playing well for Belgium. It wasn’t working out.

But, yo — come on. I was 17! 18! 19!

When things were going well, I was reading newspapers articles and they were calling me Romelu Lukaku, the Belgian striker.

When things weren’t going well, they were calling me Romelu Lukaku, the Belgian striker of Congolese descent.

If you don’t like the way I play, that’s fine. But I was born here. I grew up in Antwerp, and Liège and Brussels. I dreamed of playing for Anderlecht. I dreamed of being Vincent Kompany. I’ll start a sentence in French and finish it in Dutch, and I’ll throw in some Spanish or Portuguese or Lingala, depending on what neighborhood we’re in.

I’m Belgian.

We’re all Belgian. That’s what makes this country cool, right?

I don’t know why some people in my own country want to see me fail. I really don’t. When I went to Chelsea and I wasn’t playing, I heard them laughing at me. When I got loaned out to West Brom, I heard them laughing at me.

But it’s cool. Those people weren’t with me when we were pouring water in our cereal. If you weren’t with me when I had nothing, then you can’t really understand me.

You know what’s funny? I missed 10 years of Champions League football when I was a kid. We never could afford it. I would come into school and all the kids would be talking about the final, and I’d have no idea what happened. I remember back in 2002, when Madrid played Leverkusen, everybody was like, “The volley! Oh my God, the volley!”

I had to pretend like I knew what they were talking about.

Two weeks later, we were sitting in computer class, and one of my friends downloaded the video off the Internet, and I finally saw Zidane smash it into the top corner with his left.

That summer, I went over to his house so I could watch Ronaldo Fenomeno in the World Cup Final. Everything else from that tournament is just a story I heard from the kids at school.

Ha! I remember I had holes in my shoes in 2002. Big holes.

Twelve years later, I was playing in the World Cup.

Now I’m about to play in another World Cup, and you know what? I’m going to remember to have fun this time. Life is too short for the stress and the drama. People can say whatever they want about our team, and about me.

Man, listen — when we were kids, we couldn’t even afford to watch Thierry Henry on Match of the Day! Now I’m learning from him every day with the national team. I’m standing with the legend, in the flesh, and he’s telling me all about how to run into space like he used to do. Thierry might be the only guy in the world who watches more football than me. We debate everything. We’re sitting around and having debates about German second division football.

I’m like, “Thierry, have you seen the Fortuna Düsseldorf setup, though?”

He’s like, “Don’t be silly. Yes, of course.”

That’s the coolest thing in the world, to me.

I just really, really wish my grandad was around to witness this.

I’m not talking about the Premier League.

Not Manchester United.

Not the Champions League.

Not the World Cups.

That’s not what I mean. I just wish he was around to see the life we have now. I wish I could have one more phone call with him, and I could let him know …

“See? I told you. Your daughter is OK. No more rats in the apartment. No more sleeping on the floor. No more stress. We’re good now. We’re good …

… They don’t have to check the I.D. any more. They know our name.”

28/06/2018, 20:31 - Aunt Dora: Beautiful letter written by a father to his son and daughter 👌

Below is a letter from a renowned Hong Kong TV broadcaster and Child Psychologist to his daughter. The words are actually applicable to all of us; young and old.
This applies to all sons & daughters too. 
Parents can use this in their teachings to their children.

Dear all,

I am writing this to you because of 3 reasons

1.Life, fortune and mishaps are unpredictable, nobody knows how long he lives. 

2. I am your father, and if I don't tell you these, no one else will.

3. Whatever written is my own personal bitter experiences that perhaps could save you a lot of unnecessary heartaches. 

Remember the following as you go through life

1. Do not bear grudge towards those who are not good to you. No one has the responsibility of treating you well, except your mother and I. To those who are good to you, you have to treasure it and be thankful, and ALSO you have to be cautious, because everyone has a motive for every move. When a person is good to you, it does not mean he really will be good to you. You have to be careful, don't hastily regard him as a real friend.

2. No one is indispensable, nothing is in the world that you must possess. Once you understand this idea, it would be easier for you to go through life when people around you don't want you anymore, or when you lose what you wanted the most.

3. Life is short. 
When you waste your life today, tomorrow you would find that life is leaving you. The earlier you treasure your life, the better you enjoy life.

4. Love is nothing but a transient feeling, and this feeling would fade with time and with one's mood. If your so called loved one leaves you, be patient, time will wash away your aches and sadness. Don't over exaggerate the beauty and sweetness of love, and don't over exaggerate the sadness of falling out of love.

5.A lot of successful people did not receive a good education, that does not mean that you can be successful by not studying hard! Whatever knowledge you gain is your weapon in life. One can go from rags to riches, but one has to start from some rags!

6.I do not expect you to financially support me when I am old, neither  would I financially support your whole life. My responsibility as a supporter ends when you are grown up. After that, you decide whether you want to travel in a public transport or in your limousine, whether rich or poor.

7. You honour your words, but don't expect others to be so. You can be good to people, but don't expect people to be good to you. If you don't understand this, you would end up with unnecessary troubles.

8. I have bought lotteries for umpteen years, but could never strike any prize. That shows if you want to be rich, you have to work hard! There is no free lunch!

9. No matter how much time I have with you, let's treasure the time we have together. We do not know if we would meet again in our next life.

05/07/2018, 03:50 - Aunt Dora: MOBILE MONEY TAX IS 0.5%, NOT 1% - PRESIDENT MUSEVENI

"Mobile money transfer is a useful service. Since the informal sector is never taxed and I am always against those direct taxes on those sectors, is it too much for mobile money senders and receivers to also make a modest contribution to the development of their country? The 1% was a miscommunication. The actual figure was 0.5%. That is what we should debate on the mobile money," says President Museveni.

At the hour of my death, call me; 
And close to you bid me; That with your saints, 
I may be praising you forever and ever.

When flood comes, fish eat ants and when the flood recedes, ants eat fish. Only time matters. To make soap, oil is required. But to clean oil, soap is required. This is the irony of life. Everybody needs somebody at one point in time. Do not despise or treat anyone with scorn. There is a time for everything and for everyone. Keep trusting and waiting on God. Your time to POP will soon come. God of creating ways were seems no way! Blessed day all!!!

The Management of National Water and Sewerage Corporation regrets to inform its valued customers and the general public that there will be interruptions in water supply on Saturday 28th July, 2018 from 8am to 5pm.

This is to enable Umeme engineers undertake routine maintenance works at the Ggaba substation to improve power supply reliability at Gaba Water Works.

The entire Kampala, Mukono & Wakiso Service Areas will be affected. 

We advise our Customers to store enough water and use it sparingly as it takes time for pressure levels to build up after resuming production.

02/08/2018, 19:08 - Aunt Dora: *Your level determines your challenges*
*Sometimes you wonder why you experience big challenges in your life but I want you to know that they are proportional to your level. High level people do not face low level challenges . It’s the tallest trees that suffer the most wind. In a war they target the soldier who has the biggest weapon. In football they focus on marking the best player. The devil will attack you because he knows how powerful you are. Remember that whatever God allows you to go through he knows that you have the capacity to withstand it and come out stronger . Challenges are like steps of a ladder, each time you overcome them you go to the next level. I would rather face challenges as I go to a higher level than stay at a lower level without challenges.*

*1 Cor 10:13......And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear......*

I wish you victory always. 
When *challenges* come.. Stay *strong in faith* knowing that God will see u through. Amen

02/08/2018, 21:38 - Aunt Dora: George Carlin on aging! 
(Absolutely Brilliant) 
IF YOU DON'T READ THIS TO THE VERY END, YOU HAVE LOST A DAY IN YOUR LIFE. 

George Carlin's Views on Aging 
HOW TO STAY YOUNG   
1. Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight and height. Let the doctors worry about them. That is why you pay them. 

2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down. 

3. Keep learning.    Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening, whatever, even ham radio. Never let the brain idle. 'An idle mind is the devil's workshop.' And the devil’s   family name is   Alzheimer's. 

4. Enjoy the simple things.   

5.  Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath. 

6. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person, who is with us our entire life, is ourselves Be ALIVE while you are alive. 

7. Surround yourself with what you love   , whether it's family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge. 

8. Cherish your health: If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get help. 

9. Don't take guilt trips. Take a trip to the mall, even to the next county; to a foreign country, but NOT to where the guilt is. 

10. Tell the people you love that you love them, at every opportunity. 
AND, ALWAYS REMEMBER: 

"Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away"

We all need to live life to its fullest each day!!

17/08/2018, 18:31 - Aunt Dora: An interesting piece from Angelo Izamas blog and a call of reflection with in us..

If a planeload of senior government officials were to crush and burn today instead of days of national mourning, there may be instead days of celebration. 

Such is the mood, online and when you speak to people offline, brought on by the recent events in Arua. 

There is fear and resentment for those who wield the authority of the state. There is contempt, hate and helplessness too. It was Aime Ferdinand David Cesaire, the Martiniquean politician and poet who wrote about how violence can have a dehumanizing effect on those who wield it (by wielding it) and its victims. 

Even when those so-called victims free themselves from such violence, as was the case with the freedom from colonialization, they are marked by the violence wrought on them and as Mahmood Mamdani too said yesterday’s victims are tomorrow’s killers.

In the last three years I have surrounded myself with the literature of violence in Uganda. 

Much of it was the story of state inspired violence from 1966 – 86 and thereafter the civil wars. In particular I was struck by the confusion of the Justice Oder Commission that made inquiries into the early period (I provide links to the testimonies on my blog below) on how we had degenerated into a despicable mess. 

They wondered how all these decent Ugandan men (and women) had turned into torturers and murderers as if they had gone to a monster university to learn how to be so hateful and evil.  

“We wonder how a security personnel developed such wrath to torture and maim someone he had never seen before just because the culprit was brought under his custody” they said. They pondered if it was “sadism for its sake”. 

Today many people don’t pause to ask how the nice guy you went to school with now spends his time tracking and harming “ opposition elements”. 

Part of what violence in society does to you is to make you accept it as normal. Many people even won’t notice their own indifference to the plight of those victims until it involves someone they know or something they value. 

They fail in principle to condemn all acts of criminal violence and impunity. 

In this way even if they did not stand in the same room as the fellows who, in the most recent case, allegedly beat up Bobi Wine and others, they had already endorsed it by looking the other way when for example hundreds died in Kasese, and thousands in Northern Uganda. 

Now in their present anger they may accept violence against those they view as responsible because violence in return is a form of justice they may think.  
This is wrong of course but we all feel this way sometimes.

It is important to understand what being a witness to the madness of layers upon layers of violence does to you. For your own sanity. 

It will allow you to think clearly, or as Cesaire would say, to think dangerously even. 

One group I feel particularly sorry for are the very “bazukulu” who are unwittingly repeating our cycle of violence and dehumanization. The torturers who are our friends and bar mates whose Altezza’s and Prados we admire, who our sisters want to marry, those guys who while drowning their own despair in bottles of whiskey are the stars of the nightlife. 

We all have them in our lives. 

Mamdani once told me that they constitute also the brightest amongst us who rather than confront the mad state had become instead “handmaidens” of the same state. They were here in the 80s, driving their Peugeots, wearing expensive chains and perfumes, guns in their cars and innocent people in their car boots. 

We see them again earning their keep by obeying “orders from above”. In the period before 86’ one of the complications for society then was that the same torturers were the relatives, friends and in-laws of the dominant people in society. Intra-northern competition meant that killers were known but protected because they come from the same high society that was “in things” at the time. 

Even today in the contest between FDC (which I consider NRM in the opposition anyway), Dr. Besigye, Muntu and other leaders will have relatives, friends and in-laws amongst the very manpower that wreaks havoc on them because political contest is largely an intra-western affair. 

This contradiction allows a dangerous silence about who is doing the brutalizing. It anonymizes the perpetrators who sit behind the authority of formal state institutions. I feel particularly sorry if you are reading this and fall in the category of people who know, associate with and keep as friends these under 40-year olds who are the violent handmaidens of today’s state-based violence.

I especially understand if in your shame you are keeping quiet about the violence we see today despite what it is doing to all of us. Turning us into hateful, spiteful and even violent people in our words and deeds.  

I asked a friend, a senior citizen and mentor, who lived through it all what advise he had in such times and he said that it was important to publicly condemn impunity and reject this violence. I add to this that if you keep toxic company and cannot name or shame them.

Avoid them. 

Have a good day.

On Cesaire “ Discourses on Colonialism”
17/08/2018, 18:31 - Aunt Dora: Watching the video of 
Mrs. Barbie Kyagulanyi brought it back home for me...
My late father, Basil K. Bataringaya was "arrested" from my grandfather's home by policemen and military personnel one late morning. He was brutalized right in front of our eyes. I was hardly 6 yrs old at the time.
He was kept at the central police station of Mbarara. His name was even entered in the incidence book.
He was later transferred to Kyamugorani prison before he was disappeared. 
My late mother reported to the CPS mbarara to ask to see her husband everyday at no avail, even after he had been disappeared, until some kind lower rank policeman lead her aside and told her to go home and look after her children who still need her because she would not see her husband and her continued visits might result in her being imprisoned and God knows what might happen.
My heart goes out to Mrs. Barbie Kyagulanyi and her children. 
May the Good Lord give them strength to see them through this difficult time, and to have a chance to look after their husband and father.

19/08/2018, 22:27 - Aunt Dora: Pr.Solomon Male writes.

During the Arua by-elections, the issue of Bobi Wine hon Kyagulanyi has been blown out of proportions to the extent of causing him trouble & being framed for treason. 

What is never stated is that even without Kyagulanyi NRM camp would have lost. I don't want to dwell on FDC which is proving a spent force because of the hypocrisy of many of its MPs.

When Abiriga was killed, the conduct of youths breaking chairs must have sent signal to any sane politician that NRM would not win the by-election no matter what Museveni did. People were fed up.

The problem with Ugandan rulers is failure to discern growing discontent and turning to armed forces to brutally suppress dissent, & to judicial systems to frame, prosecute & persecute opponents with trumped up charges.

If you can recall, Uganda's problems are rulers who refuse to peacefully leave power till they are forcefully ejected.

Before end of tenure of Obote's Executive Premiership, he used the Army to overthrow the President Kabaka Sir Edward Muteesa, abrogated the constitution, came up with own constitution, turned to political opponents & imprisoned them & turned Uganda into a defacto one party state

On 25 Jan 1972, Idi Amin discerning people's discontent toppled his Commander in Chief & was named Dada ( Father) because of his action, removing a tyrant.

After tightening grip on power, Amin turned Uganda into what became to be known as the State of Blood & pronounced himself Life President. Many dissenters were either imprisoned or killed while others fled into exile & some joined armed groups which included Kikosi Malum, Fronasa, UNRF, etc. Eventually, riding on people's disgruntledness, Amin was deposed on 11 April 1979 by Tanzania People's Defense Forces backed Uganda National Liberation Army & an entire Uganda National  Army was driven into exile where many combatants later died in abject suffering.

Lule reigned barely 2 1/2 months & was deposed by his own army UNLA.

Similarly Binaisa was deposed by the Army UNLA when he attempted to cling to power.

10-11 Dec 1980 were voting days. I voted when about 18 years 4 months old. Commonwealth election observers monitored the elections & though entirely rigged, okayed it as free & fair.

When Semogerere declared that though election had been rigged, DP leadership had decided to form parliamentary opposition, Museveni who had vowed to go to the bush if the election was rigged honored his pledge and quit government, started the protracted armed struggle that finally brought him into power on 26 Jan 1986.

Back a bit, President Museveni capitalized on people's discontent with the regime to build his armed struggle power base.

People who  sheltered, fed, hid & spied for & fought for him were the ordinary & despised. Many lost their lives because of him.

His armed struggle created un healing scars in many people's lives: orphans, widows, widowers & many who lost their children, relatives & friends, besides  loss of wealth & economic collapse. Those old enough remember Panda Garis, Mpawo Atalukaaba buses, Nile Mansions torture to death chambers, NASA, etc.

Till he was deposed by his own army on 25 July 1985, Obote failed to read the tide of people's discontent & labeled NRA fighters 'bandits.' 

Even when his Chief of Staff was killed, he became even more hard hearted, intolerant, brutal & discriminative & in course creating more discontent.

Nothing much to say about the Tito Okello Lutwa led Military Junta, a marriage of convenience by different fighting groups, Moses Ali's UNRF, Nkwanga's FEDEMU, Kayiira's Uganda Freedom Movement, etc. This was marked by anarchy worsened by NRA's resolve fight them culminating into the 26 Jan 1986 NRA / NRM start of reign, & pushing an entire army into exile & precipitating insurgences (Holy Spirit Movement, Lords Resistance Army, etc). 

Many people breathed sighs of relief that at last, war was over.

At Parliamentary building after taking his first presidential oath, Museveni stated, 'This is not a mere change of guard: it is a fundamental change.'

With promises of a self-sustaining national economy, respect for human dignity, democratic governance, defining Africa's problems as stemming from presidents who don't want to leave power, castigating corruption, electoral frauds, intolerance of oppositions, abuse of power & over dependence on the West or East & polarization between pro-East & Pro-West, he won Ugandans' trust of  making Uganda the pride of Africa.

1986 to date make Museveni the longest serving President. His reign outstrips all his predecessors combined. He has had every good will to make Uganda what every right thinking Ugandan wants it to be, in vain. He has disillusioned  many of us who once thought him  God sent.

He has drowned the youths hopes: licensing slave traders to sell into slavery those desperate for jobs & greener pastures; licensing thieves to open gaming (betting) companies  to loot & impoverish Ugandans desperate for riches; cohabiting with conmen & women in the pews who target people desperate for God, Jesus, & his divine interventions in their real life problems, challenges & needs & has let witch witchdoctors con & murder Ugandans desperate for breakthroughs.

Cooperatives that once bolstered the agricultural sector were murdered. 

'Investors'  invest to kill the economy by setting up factories which import raw materials instead of using available raw materials, hence, promote foreign job creations while murdering our own job market.

Do you remember   Masaka Cooperatives Cresp company which used to extract pineapple & other juices from  pineapples & other locally grown fruits? What happened that fruits rot in Nakasero, Owino, Kalerwe & other markets? Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, Riham & other beverage producers primarily use water from Uganda & import virtually all other raw materials from abroad, killing the would be forward linkages for the agricultural sector.

It is only during NRM tenure that poultry farmers feed their chicken on sand, soils & other adulterations deliberately mixed in feeds & sold as feeds.

The health sector is broken down while those in power seek medical treatment abroad.

High corruption is the order of the day as millions of Ugandans are languishing in abject poverty & hopelessness. Thieves are protected by the state as if all Ugandans are blind & fools. 

I can write on & on. Why should people still trust Museveni & his NRM having failed for  32 years to deliver on promises?

When people like BobiWine Hon Kyagulanyi, Rtd Col Dr Kiiza Besigye,  etc emerge, just like Museveni did in the 1980s, they ride on people disillusionments to ignite change. Framing, arresting, persecuting, killing them, dismembering them, etc do not sort disillusionments, only dealing with people's needs & issues makes reform agitators irrelevant. It must be remembered that one man's perceived traitor / terrorist can be another's patriot & hero.

When General Fred Rwigyema was killed during the early days of the RPF invasion of Rwanda, did it stop RPF from over tuning Kigali & taking power? The answer is NO.

Through all the years of his protracted struggles, Museveni himself, his brother Salim Saleh, Kahinda Otafiire, Elly Tumwiine, Jim Muhwezi, name them; had they been caught, they would have all been charged for treason & as the law stipulates, if found guilty & sentenced, hanged. But Uganda would have missed their invaluable services. 

It is therefore so sad that 32 years down his reign, power has blinded Museveni & his inner circle so much to forget where he & this country have came from & his promises at Parliament in January 1986 for 'fundamental change' & not a 'mere change of guard'

Think about Mobutu Sesesekou, Muammar Gadaffi, Siad Barre, Saddam Hussein & their greed for power & how that plunged their counties into chaos they are struggling with today.

Something to think about: the fourth Estate should have always reminded HE Museveni not to forget his promises & critically highlighted where things have gone wrong but many members are timid, or compromised & are therefore puppets dancing to regime tones, or totally ignorant themselves of Uganda's long & painful, & heartbreaking journey to where we now are.

Many don't even know the lyrics 'Omwoto nawaka, omwoto nawaka... . 

Mwoto gunawaka  Kalasa nawaka, mwoto nawaka mwoto nawaka.....'

Friends, Former Singapore Premier Lee J
Kwan Yew said 'To understand the present and anticipate the future, one must know the past, enough to have a sense of the history of a people.'

Therefore Fourth Estate, instead of loose timid time wasting & noncommittal chats posted, post reminding the President, his inner circle & all Ugandans of our past so we don't mess & slip back into the dark & painful past. As you know, history can repeat itself.

Therefore do the needful to awaken Ugandans consciousness.

Thanks.

Peace & blessings.

*Father in the Mighty name of Jesus I thank You. I thank You because all power belongs to You. Thank You  because You always answer my prayers. I ask for forgiveness on behalf of our land and  nation Uganda. Forgive us for we have not walked in your ways. I repent for all wickedness, injustice, nepotism, tribalism, hatred, bloodshed, idolatry, and having not given You Your rightful place in our nation. Wherever we have exalted any idol before You, please forgive us, Lord. Father, have mercy. Remember mercy, O Lord. I contend for my country, O Lord. You say, ask of Me for the nations. Lord I ask for the land of Uganda. Remember Your people, Lord, those tossed about, oppressed and trampled upon by situations, hunger and thirst. O Lord, remember mercy and heal our land. Bring the latter rains, O Lord, I pray. Open the flood gates of heaven and let it rain. I plead the blood of Jesus over this land. Let  that Blood that speaks better things than the blood of Abel Raise leaders that are after Your heart, O Lord. Give us leaders chosen by You and let them be vessels to bring this land back to the fear of You, O Lord. Let there be peace and love for one another. Let any power thirsting for the blood of any Ugandan be quenched by the blood of Jesus. I cancel violence in Jesus name. I decree peace, prosperity and blessing to this land. Let peace be upon Uganda, let peace be upon the four corners of this great land. In the mighty name of Jesus I pray. Amen.*
For God and my country.

We are doing a 1,000,000 prayer chain. Please don't break it. Pass it to 10 of your contacts. Thank you.

04/09/2018, 03:26 - Aunt Dora: Somebody called me with this phone number 07060714545 telling me he was doing some registration online and he mistakenly put my number on what he was registering, that my number is similar to his number and that the password of what he was registering was sent to my phone which I actually saw as 6310.
He was now appealing to me to give him the reset code that was sent to my phone so that he could finish his registration. I told him to call me with the number he claimed was similar to mine so that I could verify his claim, he told me he didn't have credit in that line.
I got online to find out more, only to discover he was actually trying to reset my bank online/yahoomail password and that he is a fraudster, an account hacker and also a 419er. If I had given him the code which was sent to my phone, he would have used it to reset my bank online/mobile app account.
Please let us be careful and vigilant. Fraudsters are devising new ways every day.
This is a new way of defrauding people...
Share to prevent others from being defrauded.

These guys came to power during their youthful years, and now they are telling us to go slow on them and be cautious in our demands for regime change.
NO ONE SHOULD INTIMIDATE YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN THY ACTIVELY STAND AND DEMAND FOR WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY THEIRS.
The time for the youths is now.

05/09/2018, 16:47 - Aunt Dora: CAN A CHRISTIAN DRINK ALCOHOL? Pro 31 : 2 - 7
When a European Airline was initially launched, an educated Christian gentleman was traveling in the first class section.
An air hostess approached him with a complimentary drink, this was an alcoholic drink, but the man politely refused.
The air hostess returned but this time brought the drink on a platter, designed to appeal and impress. However, the Christian man again politely refused, explaining he doesn't drink alcohol.
The air hostess was concerned and informed the manager. The manager approached the man with another platter, now designed with flowers. He questioned, “Is there something wrong with our service? Please enjoy the drink, it is a complimentary offer.”
The man replied, “I am a Christian and I do not drink alcohol? The manager still insisted that the man take the drink. Then, the Christian proposed that the manager should give the drink to the pilot first. The manager stated, “How can the pilot drink alcohol, he’s on duty! And if he drinks there are all chances for the plane to crash”.
The Christian passenger with tears in his eyes, replied, “I am a Christian and I am ALWAYS on duty in order to protect my FAITH and if I Drink Alcohol I will crash my whole life here and hereafter. I AM 100% ON DUTY!"
Maybe yours might not be an alcohol, it may be tempting you for *sex* as it was done to *Joseph*, battling with how to control your *anger*, profane and vain *babblings*, your *dressing* , your *attitude* towards people and finally not sharing the *Word*.
Do you know that souls are dying because of those reckless behaviours of ours?

05/09/2018, 18:47 - Joanna: SAD & SHOCKING BREAKING NEWS

Bobi Wine's blood samples have tested positive for Dimethylmercury, a category 2 man made slow killing poison manufacured from North Korea. Research shows that absorption of drops as low as 0.01ml have been proven fatal with signs of poisoning manifesting after 6 months which is definitely late for any kind of treatment.
The good news is that diagnosis has been done at an early stage however his doctors have recommended thorough tests to be made at both the National Screening Center and poison control centers in the US and the Rambam Health Care Campus in Israel who possess capacity to detect all kinds of poison. Dr. Barbara Kirrane a medical toxicology consultant based at saint barnabas medical center in New Jersey has joined the medical team of doctors working on Hon. Kyagulanyi.
It is not yet clear where Hon. Bobi wine was poisoned but unconfirmed reports indicate this was done while he was arrested and held under military detention in Gulu and Makindye. It is not the first time for an opposition figure in Uganda to suffer from poisoning. Hon Hussein Kyanjo, former Makindye West MP revealed that he was poisoned when he became too vocal on the oil documents and sharing agreements that raised dust in parliament back in 2010.
We shall keep you posted as more details emerge...
the same poison that was used to kill the brother of Dr BESIGYE. (RIP )
we shall keep u posted but ur prayers are needed bambi....

08/09/2018, 15:10 - Aunt Dora: Warning from Police
DON'T SEND IT BACK PASS IT ON

This is the thing these days, with people out of work and needing cash (mainly for drugs!).  Beware, it's headed your way. Just last weekend on Friday night we parked in a public parking area.  As we drove away I noticed a sticker on the rear window of the car.  When I got home and took it off, it was a receipt for gas.  Luckily my friend had told me not to stop as it could be someone waiting for me to get out of the car.  

Then we received this email yesterday:  WARNING FROM POLICE: THIS APPLIES TO BOTH WOMEN AND MEN. BEWARE OF A PIECE OF PAPER ON THE BACK WINDOW OF YOUR VEHICLE (A NEW WAY TO DO CARJACKING!)(NOT A JOKE!) Heads up everyone!  Please, keep this circulating.You walk across the parking lot, unlock your car and get inside.  You start the engine and shift into reverse.  When you look into the rearview mirror to back out of your parking space, you notice a piece of paper stuck to the middle of the rear window.  So, you shift into Park, unlock your doors, and jump out of your car to remove that paper (or whatever it is) that is obstructing your view.  When you reach the back of your car, that is when the carjackers appear out of nowhere, jump into your car and take off.  They practically mow you down as they speed off in your car. And guess what, ladies ?  I bet your purse is still in the car! So now the carjacker has your car, your home address, your money, and your keys.  Your home and your whole identity are now compromised!BEWARE OF THIS NEW SCHEME THAT IS NOW BEING USED.If you see a piece of paper stuck to your back window, just drive away.  Remove the paper later!  And be thankful that you read this e-mail.

I hope you will forward this to friends and family, especially to women.  A purse contains all kinds  of personal information and identification documents, and you certainly do NOT want it to fall into the wrong hands.Please keep this going and tell all your family and friends!

DON'T SAY, I DON'T HAVE A CAR YET, BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR RELATIVES? 
PASS IT ON.
09/09/2018, 17:19 - Aunt Dora: PLEASE, Pray for our country Uganda🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

OPEN LETTER TO SHWENKURU (JAJJA) YOWERI KAGUTA MUSEVENI

Dear Grandpa,

RE: WE WERE NOT BORN THIS WAY!
I hope this letter finds you in perfect health and good moods having prayed and believed that your handlers will let it reach plainly as written. (One finds it difficult to imagine how they report events to you.)

Permit me to remind you that our story begun in Arua on 16th November 2015. During our meeting I informed you that you were dealing with a Kyemeza generation (Young people born during the 1980’s and 90s who had just grown up like a neglected plant without pruning). Grandpa you responded by saying that the “political pruning” fell under the docket of the office of National Political Commissar which prior to return of multiparty democracy and later Office of Secretary General which had been occupied by the following notable individuals; Col. Dr. Kizza Besigye, Dr. Chrispus Kiyonga and Rt. Hon. Amama Mbabazi. You asserted that Col. Dr. Kizza Besigye and Rt. Hon. Amama Mbabazi could have deliberately neglected this duty for their selfish gains (To use ideologically bankrupt youth to cause confusion) I thought I understood!

Grandpa, I reiterate, we your bazukulu were not born this way, we were left to grow this way deliberately or otherwise. I will elaborate; 

ON HOOLIGANISM.

Grandpa, you say we are hooligans, we were not born this way, the system made us believe hooliganism is a way of life. Remember Maj. Kakooza Mutale and his Kalangala Action Plan which has been meting out election violence since 2001? Grandpa you never condemned them even when former Electoral Commission Chairman Hajji Badru Kiggundu called for an investigation on them in 2011.

Grandpa you remember on 10th August 2016 when a mob of “cadres” loyal to then our darling IGP uncle Kale Kayihura almost lynched judicial officers at Makindye Magistrates Court? Grandpa you never said that was hooliganism.

Grandpa you remember on 3rd October 2017 when your then “loyal cadres” of Boda Boda 2010 attacked school children at Busega and battered a police officer? You never condemned them and we believed it was okay. Grandpa don’t say they are now in court, they are there on other charges not related to that incident. At least we now know that murder and kidnap are not politically accepted forms of violence.

Grandpa the smashing of car windows was acknowledged as acceptable form of behavior on 28th April 2011 when Cadre Arinaitwe Gilbert Bwana smashed Dr. Kizza Besigye’s car and he was praised for his courage instead being reprimanded.

ON REPORTING ERRATIC BEHAVIOR.

Grandpa over the years we have learnt that when we, the bazukulu, report to you any wrongdoing on the part of officials closer to you, you never act (or take too long to act) and we end up suffering at the hands of these officials. 

Grandpa you remember Muzukulu Kirumira Muhamadi who informed you of “weevils” in police force way back in 2013 and you took long to act? He was ostracized, harassed and treated like “a rolex thief”. Grandpa he ended up being stripped of his hard-earned ranks and livelihood. 

Grandpa, on 17th May 2017 I wrote to Uncle Kale ,then IGP, requesting that he restores the waning image of Uganda Police Force by causing the arrest and trial of those involved in torturing suspects in Nalufenya, a letter I copied to you (Attached hereto). Grandpa you addressed this issue passively. It is not by accident that we still witness incidences of torture occasioned by members of the armed forces. We were not born this way Grandpa, you made us believe reporting erratic behavior was useless.

ON BEING UNRELIABLE.

Grandpa, your handlers say we are unreliable. How can we be reliable when during the 2016 Presidential Election campaigns some of the senior officials you assigned us to work with stole campaign funds and when we threatened them that we shall report them to you they arrogantly responded that you shall do nothing? Grandpa they were wrong. You didn’t do nothing, you appointed some of them in more powerful offices. We were so naïve grandpa. We didn’t know scheming off a few hundreds of millions to buy ourselves some toys was acceptable.

Shwenkuru…Grandpa, how can you kunegura your bazukulu? Grandpa, during the same election period you gave some of your buzukulu SUVs and SFC guards saying their security and lives mattered to you. Grandpa immediately after elections you withdrew the cars and guards. Why grandpa? Why? Did their security and lives cease to matter? Grandpa we were not born this way, you made us believe we only matter during elections.

The various Nyekundiire bazukulu groups such as Sauti ya vijana, Sauti ya wanainchi, Team Thorough, Western Youth Forum, NRM Rich Mind Youth, including NRM Youth League at lower levels who campaigned tirelessly for and were darlings during elections are burdening under the weight of broken promises, silently waiting for 2021 because when we attempt to join those who criticize the system society reminds us of how we shouted our voices hoarse in your support. Grandpa, what are we supposed to do under these disheartening circumstance?

ON CORRUPTION.

Grandpa you have been informed about how some people in your office have turned you into a commodity. An appointment with you comes at a cost, no wonder the likes of Bryan White have special seats in your tent. Grandpa we were not born this way, you have made us believe that what matters is having money regardless of how we get it. We constantly see glorified thieves and humiliated hard-working people.

Shwenkuru, your bazukulu who worked in your call center of Tuongee were laid off without any compensation for their efforts. The same happened to those who worked in your office of National Chairman – NRM under Madam Molly Kamukama, the new PA came with new staff ethnically close to her. Why burden you Grandpa? Of course, you already know all this.

Grandpa, you have been complaining of corruption for over 50years yet our uncles and aunties who are implicated in corruption scandals are awarded with juicy positions. Grandpa we were not born this way, we see these relatives on the streets where we toil every day, cruising in convoys with lead cars and we don’t know what to do, give us a signal grandpa, tell us what to do because we cannot pelt them with stones, the SFC will clobber us.

ON SELFISHNESS.

Grandpa, we were not born selfish, your muzukulu Buntu Enock, NRM Youth League Treasurer went missing almost 4 months ago. I say missing because the security agencies say they don’t have him yet his family members say he was picked by security operatives. But Grandpa when we meet you as executive committees  representing young people both NRM Youth League and National Youth Council we are too preoccupied with getting mugaati from you for our individual stomachs to remember the welfare of one of our own. We are too afraid to use social media #FreeBuntuEnock yet we join the crowd to say #FreeBobiWine because its what is trending.

ON PEOPLE POWER.

Grandpa, your handlers mislead you that “People Power Crusade” is made of “ideologically disoriented hooligans being misled by opportunistic opposition politicians”, which is not true. Allow me point out one group called “Kawempe Republic” which has featured in all campaigns from Kyadondo East, to Jinja Municipality, to Bugiri and even Arua. This group is made up of NRM youthful cadres who worked closely with officials in your office of National Chairman – NRM and after underwent ideological training at National Leadership Institute – Kyankwanzi (I know this because we were in the same intake). These cadres while at Kyankwanzi even composed the NRM Anthem with the guidance of Mr. Micheal Katungi. The reason for them joining “People Power” was highlighted recently by NRM Deputy Secretary General Hon. Todwong Richard as “…because NRM party failed to handle issues affecting them”.

ON POOR PARENTING.

Grandpa, uncle Gen. Elly Tumwine said we do all this because of poor parenting. It is true. The moral fabric of this nation was destroyed by bad examples. The ideology we are taught in Kyankwanzi is not what is practiced in the corridors of power. The revolutionary methods of work were relegated to the textbook long before some of us even learnt to speak. We are decaying Grandpa but we were not born this way, we have learnt from some of the worst political parents anyone can ever have. (Kwoza kwiba ohekire oba noyegyesa oryomungozi).

ON DISRESPECT.

Grandpa, you may have heard or seen people referring to you as “Bosiko”, Bosiko is a character in MTN Momo advert who came from the village on a bicycle and mastered the ways of the city. Some may use it to demean your person and to others it is good intentioned humor to the bazukulu by the bazukulu that eases these moments of tension. Ultimately what this signifies is that as an individual, by riding the bicycle carrying water and grass for the demonstration farm, you  demystified (ust like you demystified the gun) the image of the holder of the highest office in the land as a common man who has simply mastered the art of managing people. The best part in that advert is where Bosiko accidentally sits on the birthday cake for his children, takes them to the nearest shop and buys them queen cakes (Bwa keeki obwa bitaano). Clearly, kwoyaka omwana endahi omukwatsa ekyisamutuutu! Grandpa, some people sat on our cake and damaged it, we are dying of hunger both ideological and physical, please provide some queen cakes before we degenerate beyond salvage.

Your honest Muzukulu

Since Museveni has been the most mentioned name in Uganda this past years, I think Oxford Dictionary should consider creating a space for him in the dictionary.
For example:
Museveni: /mu-se-ve-n/ adjective: hard, difficult, painful , troublesome, harsh, wicked, liar, bad, thief.
.Verb: Musevenu.
. Past Tense: Musevenirised
. Present Continuous:Musevening
. Present Perfect: Mesevenise
E.g:
... Some girls always like to musevenise things,
.
... The test was Musevenistic,
.
... I had a very Musevenirised week.
# Museveni: To complicate, make things worse, unbearable.
E.g:
... Please don't come and Museveniificate issues here.
... The only way to reduce applicants is to Musevenify the process.
... How was your exam? It was Musevenific !!

19/09/2018, 06:19 - Aunt Dora: YOWERI MUSEVENI IS NOT UGANDAN - HIS STORY 

EXPOSED: 95% of Ugandans do not understand the real Yoseri Tibuhaburwa Rutabasirwa Buzariranwa.

Yoseri Tibuhaburwa Rutabasirwa Buzariranwa AKA Yoweri Kaguta Museveni is a Tutsi of Rwandan origin. He was born in Gisenyi, northern Rwanda.

During the Hutu revolution (1959 to 1961) which overthrew the minority Tutsi dominion of Rwanda, Museveni and his mother (Esteri Kokundeka) left Rwanda and entered western Uganda as refugees. They were welcomed and well fed. Museveni's real father (Kayibanda) remained in Rwanda and then settled in Tanzania. After some time, Museveni's mother (Esteri Kokundeka) took another Rwandan man (Amos Kaguta) his step father. The two made love and got pregnant. The child born was named Caleb Akandhanaho AKA Salim Saleh and other siblings.

Both parents were actually Rwandan refugees. Because of economic hardships in Rwanda, they decided to stay in Uganda illegally. Uganda was very kind to Mr Museveni. Uganda educated Museveni. After his school, Museveni decided to turn the barrels of the gun against the Ugandans who fed him and educated him. He shot his way to power through violence. When he took power in 1986, claimed that he was a Ugandan citizen of Ankole origin.

He never restored the Ankole kingdom because they refused to recognize him as a munyankole and support him in the 1980's election. He was also living in fear that Ugandans might find out his true identity which might sabotage his chances of becoming the president of Uganda. Which means he would have not convinced the Baganda and others to join his bush war struggle. Being born a Rwandese means he does not qualify for the presidency of Uganda according to the constitution. You must be a born Ugandan to run for the presidency. He continues to be in power illegally and imposing himself on Ugandans.

In 1995 he also changed Uganda's constitution to recognize Rwandese as a tribe in Uganda. Rwandese disguising and infiltrating the Ugandan government as Banyankole has also caused serious division between the Bairu-Bahima. Cause now you have the lower class and the upper class undermining one another. Which is causing a stereotype and misunderstanding against hard working Banyankole. Thinking that they (Banyankole) are all rich, lazy, favored and benefiting (scholarships, gov't top positions and the army) from his government which is not true, as this has become a common stereotype with the average Ugandan today.

If you have been to Uganda its a beautiful country blessed with landscapes and nature. But corruption is one thing that can't go unnoticed. Yes, Uganda is being mismanaged in every sector across the country because Mr Museveni decides to choose family members (Nepotism) and (tribal loyalty) over competency. In the end result it has produced a failed state. If any of these people swindle public funds they would not be brought to account because they are related or have tribal loyalty to Mr Museveni.

His survival to cling onto power depends on tribalism, favouritism and nepotism. In most cases, these people are incompetent and not qualified for certain key positions. That's why we have poor infrastructure, poor service delivery, poor currency, corruption and high crime rate. If anyone questions the status quo of our country's affairs your immediately accused of being tribal.

But hey, that's not the point here.......

To trace a certain problem affecting a nation or an individual. You investigate and find out the root causes......(Its called history) Yoseri Tibuhaburwa Rutabasirwa Buzariranwa AKA Yoweri Kaguta Museveni is not a Ugandan and will never be one.......plain and simple.

Note" there are not my words but history reveals its self you can't run from ur history.

24/09/2018, 07:52 - Aunt Dora: UPDF should not be deployed against citizens, says Bobi’s lawyer
Mr Robert Amsterdam recently burst onto the Ugandan scene following reports that he had been hired by Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine. Derrick Wandera caught up with Mr Amsterdam in an email interview.

First things first, how did you meet Bobi Wine?
A human rights NGO asked me to help him when arrested in Arua. As torture was involved, I sent a lawyer the next day. Simon Wolfe.

Is Bobi Wine paying you to represent him?
I don’t discuss money when torture is involved. I have suffered personally from oppression which is why the narrative of the government is so funny. Their statements about me are not only lies but they are incredibly stupid. How can I be a Western [agent] when I often represent Western critics?

And what reason would you have for representing Western critics?
The West has been a mess for Africa. The focus on terrorism and the funding of armies is contrary to our interests as Africans. I am sorry if you look at me [and] I don’t look African, but Africa is within me and my children as I have been in Nigeria off and on since I was a boy.

Talking of interests of countries, you have been accused of being a Western agent
Not at all. I won the global prize for pro bono advocacy for my work against the UN where they abused a leading African expert. Instead the government tries to paint me as some Western agent. I am the farthest thing from that.

You have been accused of destabilising governments…
It’s a complete fabrication. I was asked to help Bobi by a human rights organisation. The fabrications in some recent articles in Uganda are just laughable.

Why represent Bobi Wine for free?
He is an incredible, talented charismatic emblem of African youth. He is a phenomenon to be embraced. We need to understand our youth is our only resource. I agree with Bobi. It’s not about him, it’s about the people. People power is what we all must embrace. It is a way to embrace change and economic and political growth.

You have previously represented high profile politicians from around the world. How different is Bobi Wine’s case?
Very different. None of my other clients were tortured. Uganda is somewhat similar to my work in Thailand.

What happened in Thailand?
Ninety eight [people were] murdered in cold blood during the Bangkok Massacre [in 2010]. I took them to ICC [International Criminal Court] and were charged with defaming the army. Very tricky.

You represented former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra who was accused of abuses, including murders by his government. Isn’t this a contradiction for a person who says he stands for human rights?
It is a phony fact. Thaksin took 25 per cent of the populace out of poverty. He is a hero to the Thai people which is why the military came up with bogus challenges.
During your maiden press conference with Bobi Wine in Washington recently, you seemed to ask investors to rethink doing business with Uganda. Don’t you think this jeopardises the lives of millions of Ugandan’s who benefit from these foreign investors?
No. The army jeopardises their lives. The government through its use of violence destabilises the country. I am simply a lawyer.

You want the US to stop giving military aid to Uganda. Can’t this be looked at as to a move to weaken the UPDF’s capability to defend the nation, and to protect Uganda’s vital national interests?
You are kidding right? The army needs training not more ammo. Right now they need to stop being deployed against their own citizens.

How would you rate the Bobi case in regard to the other cases you have been handling?
The government seems to have no real programmes for urban youth and development. They need to challenge themselves. It is at the end about serving the people of Uganda and Africa.

What do you think Uganda’s problem is?
Government must be an engine of h

28/09/2018, 19:48 - Aunt Dora: *Letter from a Late Parent to the son three days after burial:*

Dear Son, 

I want to know why I died like a poor person when I have a Son like you. 

My Son, I wanted to bless you before I die, but now I have gone with my blessings. 

My breakfast, my lunch and my dinner was one of my challenges when I was alive, but u spent money to cook all types of foods, meats and different types of  drinks on my burial day. 

My Son, you choose to spread and rubbed my dead body with costly fragrance when I was using groundnut oil as my favourite cream. 

You dressed my Corpse with an expensive cloth when it was difficult to buy a wrapper for me. 

When my Corpse was in the Mortuary you came to check on me from time to time, you care about my Corpse than when I was alive why ? 

The most painful thing is the kind of expensive coffin you put my Corpse when I was living in an uncompleted house. 

When you were young I starved for you to eat and satisfied, I wore one cloth in order to provide enough clothes for you. I thought you would take care of me when I grow old. 

You completed the house, painted it and cleared the compound in one week just to celebrate my Corpse.

Now you wrote tribute to me saying "I love you so much rest in peace" - When I died with a broken heart. 

Finally, my son, I wrote this to remind you that there is no other person that loves a child like a parent. May God forgive you.

God bless you...

02/10/2018, 16:41 - Aunt Dora: This Piece blessed me a big deal👇🏾Plzzz go thru

Years ago in the Philippines, I heard a story of a man who parked his car in his office complex in downtown Manila. 

There was a street boy nearby and to pick up some money, the boy asked if he could watch (guard) the man’s car while he was in the office.

Several hours later, when the man came back to get his nice Mercedes, he paid the boy some loose change and, as he was getting in his car, the little street boy said, “Mister, you sure have a nice car.” 

The man was quite surprised that this boy had even spoken to him and said, “Well, thank you.” Then the little boy said, “Where did you get your car? Did somebody give it to you?” The man replied, “Well yes, somebody did give it to me. 

My brother gave it to me.”As he continued to get in the car, he expected the boy to say something like, “Oh, I wish I had a brother who would give me a nice car.” 

Instead, he heard the little boy say, “Your brother gave it to you? I wish I could be a brother like that.

The man was so amazed at the statement of the little boy, he asked, “Have you ever been in a nice car like this?” The little boy said, “No.” The man replied, “Well, get in. Let me give you a ride.” 

The boy jumped up in the front seat and as they drove down the road, the man had to roll down the windows because the little boy was so smelly.

The boy was so joyful and in awe that he said, “Sir, could we go get my little brother and give him a ride too?” The man said, “Tell me about your brother. Where is he?” The boy pointed at a poor slum area of Manila called Tondo. 

They drove there and parked and the man said, “Go get your brother and we will give him a ride.”

The little boy ran down a filthy alleyway and a few minutes later came back with his little brother on his back, as he was crippled! The man said, “So this is your little brother; what’s wrong with him?” as they put him up in the front seat. 

The little boy said, “He had an accident. He’s crippled and can’t walk.”

As they drove and talked, the man found out that the brother had a crippling accident and because his family was so poor, they could not get him the medical care he needed.

The businessman said, “Well, my brother is a doctor. Why don’t we go see him and find out what he can do for your little brother.” 

After the examination they found that after a simple operation, the boy would be able to walk again. 

The operation was performed and the little boy who could not walk, but had a brother who loved him, was able to walk again.

Why did all this happen? Simply because of the unselfishness of someone caring for someone else, rather than for himself. 

So, might we have the words on our lips, “I wish I could be a brother (or mother, father, sister, fellow worker) like that.”

In the words of the missionary, the Apostle Paul, “…regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others” (Philippians 2:3-4, NASB).

Yes, “I wish I could be a brother like that.”

*Using Telephone in the Darkness.*
*FORWARDED AS RECEIVED!!*

*Dr Justice Arthur, who's a medical officer at Cape Coast hospital ( Bakkano) appealed to have this post shared with all your friends and family members,as soon as possible. He says its very important.*

*Pls do not ignore or delay reading this:*

*When lights are off at night, one must not view the hand phone! (Smartphone)*

*Please share with family friends URGENTLY....*.

*Habitually using hand phones before bedtime in the dark can lead to serious problems.*

*Recently, an increasing number of 30-40 year-old patients are seeking medical attention due to using hand phones in the dark.*

*Professor Li Li, director of the Hospital of Ophthalmology SGH Singapore, said: direct glare of >30 minutes would cause irreversible eye macular degeneration that leads to rapid deterioration of vision.*

*Contracting maculopathy (eye cancer) means waiting for loss of sight because modern medicine cannot treat, let alone cure it.*
*The bright phone in the dark with close-up view high-energy directed at the eyes will damage the macula of the eye.*

*Professor Li Li said that symptoms of macular degeneration is mostly experienced by old people, but lately patients are getting younger. Patients who are 30-40 years of age increased by 3 %, most are frequent users of hand phones.*

*However, viewing the hand phone in the dark not only causes macular degeneration. It initially causes dry eyes, cataracts and eventually loss of sight.*

*Early lesions of the eye have to be treated with laser or injection of steroids.*

*254 Hospital eye specialist Professor Li Li suggested that the most important thing is to get rid of the bad habit of using hand phones in the dark. Because habitual use of hand phones in the dark b4 bedtime may cause a lifetime of harm.*

*Friends : In order to look after ourselves and our families, remember not to turn off the lights if viewing the hand phone. Inform hand phone users urgently that viewing hand phones in the dark can easily lead to loss of sight!*

🎅🤶
✍written by 
a class of 7-yearolds
👦👧
You'll love it... 

😘Grandparents are 
a lady and a man 
who have no little children of their own.  

😘They like other people's children.

😘They live at the airport from where we need to pick them up and later drop back too.


😘A grandfather is a man, and a grandmother is a lady! 

😘Grandparents don't have to do anything except be there when we come to fetch them. 

😘They are so old they shouldn't play hard or run.  

😘It is good if they drive us to the shops and give us money. 

😘When they take us for walks, they slow down past things like pretty leaves and caterpillars. 

😘They show us and talk to us about the colors of the flowers and also why we shouldn't step on 'cracks.' 

😘They don't say, 'Hurry up.' 

😘Usually they are fat but not too fat to tie your shoes. 

😘They wear glasses and funny underwear. 

😘They can take their teeth and gums out. 

😘Grandparents don't have to be smart. 

😘They have to answer questions like 'Why isn't God married?' and 'How come dogs chase cats?' 

😘When they read to us, they don't skip.  

😘They don't mind if we ask for the same story over again. 

😘Everybody should try to have a grandmother, especially if you don't have television because they are the only grownups who like to spend time with us...

😘They know we should have snack time before bed time.

😘They say prayers with us and kiss us even when we've acted bad. 

😘Grandpa is the smartest man on earth!  

😘He teaches me good things, but I don't get to see him enough to get as smart as he is.

To;
📲grandparents 🧖🏼‍♂🧖🏿‍♀
and 
📲everyone🙋🏿‍♀🙋🏾‍♂

The Prostate Gland and its effect on us , (men only). 
Read it and apply, esp the part on diet.
Useful for all MEN over-40:

A useful article / talk on Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) or in simple terms, Enlarged Prostate. Diet is the most important part of this talk which is something within our control; and it works. 

FULL TEXT OF PROSTATE HEALTH AWARENESS LECTURE

MEN MUST READ

Gentlemen,

I am here to speak with you on Prostate. The topic is misleading. Is prostate strictly for men? Yes, ONLY men have prostate and ONLY men over 40 years but the healthcare enlightenment is for everyone. There is no woman who does not know a man 40 years and above, father, uncle, brother, son, friend, neighbour, colleague...

Essentially what I will be doing today is health promotion. Responsible health promotion must provide three things:

1. Information
2. Reassurance
3. A plan of action.

Let me start with a background on prostate health.

Everyone has a pair of kidneys. The job of the kidney is to remove waste. It is the LAWMA (waste management company) of your body. Everyday your blood passes through the kidney several times to be filtered. As the blood is filtered, urine is formed and stored in a temporary storage tank called the urinary bladder.

If there were to be no urinary bladder, as a man walks on the road, urine will be dropping.

Now think of the plumbing work in your house. Think of the urinary bladder as the overhead storage tank. From the storage tank, a good plumber will run pipes to other parts of the house, including the kitchen. God in His wisdom ran pipes from our urinary bladder to the tip of the penis. The pipe is called the urethra. Just below the bladder and surrounding the urethra is a little organ called the prostate gland.

The prostate gland is the size of a walnut and weighs about 20grams. Its job is to make the seminal fluid which is stored in the seminal vesicle. During sexual intercourse, seminal fluid comes down the urethra and mixes with the sperms produced in the testicles to form the semen. So semen technically is not sperm. It is sperm + seminal fluid. The seminal fluid lubricates the sperm.

After age 40, for reasons that may be hormonal, the prostate gland begins to enlarge. From 20 grams it may grow to almost 100 grams. As it enlarges, it squeezes the urethra and the man begins to notice changes in the way he urinates.

If you have a son under 10, if he has a little mischief like we all did at that age, when he comes out to urinate, he can target the ceiling and the jet will hit target. Call his father to do same, wahala dey. His urine stream is weak, cannot travel a long distance and sometimes may come straight down on his legs. So he may need to stand in awkward position to urinate.

Not many men will be worried their urine stream cannot hit the ceiling. Toilets are on the floor and not on the ceiling. But other symptoms begin to show.

TERMINAL DRIPPLING:

The man begins to notice that after urinating and repacking, urine still drops on his pants. This is the reason why after an older man urinates, he has to ring bell. A younger man simply delivers to the last drop and walks away. Just see an older man coming from the bathroom. Sometimes he may clutch the newspaper closely to hide the urine stains, particularly on plain colored trousers.

HESISTANCY

At this point you wait longer for the urine flow to start. There are 2 valves that must open for you to urinate – the internal and external sphincters. Both open but because of obstructions in the urethra, you wait longer for the flow to start.

INCOMPLETE EMPTYING

You have this feeling immediately after urinating that there is still something left.

As all these things happen, the bladder begins to work harder to compensate for the obstruction in the urethra. The frequency of urination goes up. Urgency sets in. Sometimes you have to practically run into the toilet. Nocturia also becomes common. You wake up more than 2 times at night to urinate. Your wife begins to complain.

Men being men may not talk to anyone even at this point. Then the more serious complications start.

Stored urine gets infected and there may be burning sensation when urinating.

Stored urine forms crystals. Crystals come together to form stone either in the bladder or in the kidney. Stones may block the urethra.

Chronic urinary retention sets in. The bladder stores more and more urine. The size of the bladder is 40 - 60cl. A bottle of coke is 50cl. As the bladder stores more urine it can enlarge up to 300cl. An overfilled bladder may leak and this leads to wetting / urinary incontinence. Also the volume may put pressure on the kidney and may lead to kidney damage.

What may likely bring the man to hospital is acute urinary retention. He wakes up one day and he is not able to pass urine.

Everything I have described above is associated with prostate enlargement, technically called benign prostate hyperplasia.

There are other diseases of the prostate like:

1. Prostatitis – inflammation of the prostate

2. Prostate cancer – cancer of the prostate.

This discussion is on prostate enlargement.

I have bad news and good news.

The bad news is that everyman will have prostate enlargement if he lives long enough.

The good news is that there are life style changes that can help the man after 40 to maintain optimum prostate health.

NUTRITION

Look at what you eat. 33% of all cancers, according to the US National Cancer Institute is related to what we eat.
Red meat everyday triples your chances of prostate disease. Milk everyday doubles your risk. Not taking fruits / vegetables daily quadruples your risk.

Tomatoes are very good for men. If that is the only thing your wife can present in the evening, eat it with joy. It has loads of lycopene. Lycopene is the most potent natural antioxidant.
Foods that are rich in zinc are also good for men. We recommend pumpkin seeds (ugbogulu).
Zinc is about the most essential element for male sexuality and fertility.

Men need more zinc than women. Every time a man ejaculates he loses 15mg of zinc. Zinc is also important for alcohol metabolism. Your liver needs zinc to metabolize alcohol.

ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION

As men begin to have urinary symptoms associated with prostate enlargement, it is important they look at alcohol consumption. More fluid in means more fluid out. 

Drink less. Drink slowly.

EXERCISE

Exercise helps build the muscle tone. Every man should exercise. Men over 40 should avoid high impact exercise like jogging. It puts pressure on the knees. Cycling is bad news for the prostate. We recommend brisk walking.

SITTING
When we sit, two-third of our weight rests on the pelvic bones. Men who sit longer are more prone to prostate symptoms. Do not sit for long hours. Walk around as often as you can. Sit on comfortable chairs. We recommend a divided saddle chair if you must sit long hours.

DRESSING

Men should avoid tight underwear. It impacts circulation around the groin and heats it up a bit. While the physiological temperature is 37 degrees, the groin has an optimal temperature of about 33 degrees. Pant is a no - no for men. Wear boxers.  Wear breathable clothing.

SMOKING

Avoid smoking. It affects blood vessels and impact circulation around the groin.

SEX

Regular sex is good for the prostate.

Celibates are more pronenn to prostate illness. While celibacy is a moral decision, it is not a biological adaptation. Your prostate gland is designed to empty its contents regularly.

"Pieces of lemon in a glass of hot water can save you for the rest of your life," says Professor Chen Horin, chief executive of the Beijing Military Hospital.

Hot lemons can kill cancer cells!

Cut the lemon into three pieces and place it in a cup, then pour hot water, it will become (alkaline water), drink it every day will certainly benefit everyone ..

Hot lemons can once again release an anti-cancer drug.

Hot lemon juice has an effect on cancerous tumors and

has shown treatment for all types of cancer.

Treatment with this extract will only destroy the malignant cells and will not affect healthy cells.

Second: The acids and mono-carboxylic acid in lemon juice can regulate hypertension and protect narrow arteries, adjust blood circulation and reduce blood clotting.

Today let's pray for all marriages and families that are facing hardships at home. Let's pray for reconciliation and peace for them all. May St. Jude guide them through each day that feels impossible.

Here are the prayers for today: 

Day 5 - The St. Jude Novena
(Audio/Video Version)

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

Most holy St. Jude – apostle, martyr and friend of Jesus, today I ask that you pray for me and my intentions!

(State your intentions here)

You are the patron of the impossible. Pray for me and my intentions! O St. Jude, pray that God’s grace and mercy will cover my intentions. Pray for the impossible if it is God’s will.

Pray that I may have the grace to accept God’s holy will even if it is painful and difficult for me.

St. Jude, you sacrificed for the Kingdom of God, pray that I may sacrifice like you.

O St. Jude, pray for me that I may grow in faith, hope and love and in the grace of Jesus Christ. Pray for these intentions, but most of all pray that I may join you in heaven with God for all eternity.

Amen.

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

24/10/2018, 04:32 - Joanna: ☝🏽fake news
24/10/2018, 04:33 - Joanna: Please be aware of the fraudsters. This morning I recieved a call from a man who claimed to be from Airtel claiming that they are in process of matching our names with national IDs in order to delete those other names that could have been erroneously recorded using my Nim. Then asked if had money on mobile wallet. He then read me this no:*185*1*1*706763206*295011* ......then secret code# then yes. If you get a call telling you to enter those codes they are fraudsters wanting to hack into your mobile money wallet and leave you empty. Just ignore them. I switched off my phone when I sensed they were fraudsters.
24/10/2018, 22:25 - Anna Christine: NCT - Peace be with you!
In keeping with the theme of impossible and hopeless causes, let's pray today for everyone who has left the Church. Let's pray for their conversion and their return to the Church.

Here are the prayers for today:

With the current INCREASE IN PRICE OF EVERYTHING, we should be grateful to GOD that HE has not INCREASED THE TITHE TO 15%; it's still 10%. Be faithful & don't rob GOD!

Even with the economic situation (inflation), the WAGES OF SIN has not changed; the price remains death! Therefore, sin no more! And follow HIM sincerely.

GOD bless you in JESUS Mighty Name, Amen

Happy Feast of St. Jude! 

Thank you for joining us in praying through his intercession! 

Here at Pray More Novenas, at the end of every novena, we always pray the following as our final prayer.

Here are the prayers for today:
Final Prayer - St. Jude Novena
(Audio/Video Version)
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

Dear Lord Jesus, I have specific requests that may only partially fill the infinite needs and desires that are in my heart. I ask that You answer me not only for those requests but also for a greater reliance on You to satisfy the needs and desires that You have given me. 

Please grant the prayers of all those who prayed this novena with me. Bless them with Your love and make them holy!

May I seek You with a sincere heart knowing that it will profit me nothing if I gain the whole world yet lose my soul. 

So, help me to see Your good and gracious purpose in all my trials. Help me to see Your blessings in every day and help me to love You more. 

Thank You for everything, Lord Jesus! 

Amen.

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

Now continue pretending that you are still young.
Just by seeing the above ages and passing by.... You know you are old.
I'm not here to give you heart attack but to make you think twice about your age and your eternal destination. As each day passes by, we are moving closer to our grave. The question now is..... What have you been able to achieve on God's behalf
since you arrived on this earth? Is that the best you can do? Do something now! Time is not waiting for any man. You are growing older by the day.
Lay your treasures in heaven, this earth is temporal. Give God your total submission. Every soul shall taste death  and you shall face judgement. Then, whoever escapes hell, is admitted to heaven. The life of this world is merely a temporary enjoyment, which is VANITY. 
Think about it now, else the next 24 hours might be too late. May God continue to help us to remember Him in everything we are doing amen.                                        
Shared as Received please, let someone know that this world is not our permanent Home. Thank you!

01/11/2018, 19:16 - Aunt Dora: *FAKE EGGS IN UGANDA😱*
 
In a disturbing case, the Police is hunting for four Chinese men who are reportedly making and selling fake eggs that look like chicken eggs.

The unscrupulous entrepreneurs no longer wait for a hen to lay eggs, they make them using machines and chemicals. The fake eggs are made from concoctions that make them look like real eggs and are hard to distinguish. This was revealed during a sensitisation conference on the mandate of Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS) at Silver Springs Hotel in Bugolobi, Kampala.

Tip-off 
A senior Police investigation officer blew the lid on the puzzling practice that is raising concern about the safety of eggs available on the local market. “We got a tip from a lady who was mistreated by the Chinese and later dismissed. She gave us information that her former bosses were manufacturing eggs in Kawempe along Ttula road. We stormed the place but, unfortunately, the Chinese detected our officers and took off. We managed to arrested the two Ugandan men who were working with them,” Charles Twine, an economic crimes and anti-corruption officer at CID headquarters, said.

According to Police investigations, the Chinese were detected in Tanzania and they shifted to Uganda. They used to import the chemicals for making the egg york and shells. “It is hard to distinguish between the fake eggs and the real ones. But when you crack the fake one, the shell comes off easily without leaving particles. When you salt it, the salt does not stick well because of the oil they use. It is hard to digest and has a funny taste,” Twine said.

The chemicals which were picked from the Chinese factory are to be sent to the Government Analytical Laboratory to find out exactly what they contained and the dangers. The fake eggs are often sold at a slightly lower price compared to the market rate.

A tray of normal eggs costs sh12,000, while the fake ones goes for sh8,000. The fake eggs are usually found in supermarkets and big markets like Kalerwe, Nakawa, Owino and Nakasero.

Slow court process 
Twine said they get so many people with deadly products, but the court punishments are so weak. “The punishment for food adulteration is weak, yet the products cause death. That is why these days people have so many strange diseases. We need strong regional co-operation if we are to fight these economic crimes,” Twine said.

Consumers have been called upon to be vigilant while buying eggs from supermarkets, shops, vendors and markets. UNBS comments Denis Odur, the UNBS market surveillance officer, confirmed the fake eggs report, saying they were waiting for Police investigations.

“We received the information and when we visited the premises, we found some of their products wrongly packed with tampered expiry dates. We seized all the products and we are waiting for Police to finish investigations in order to pursue the case,” Odur said.

Martin Imalingat, the UNBS head of market surveillance, called upon people to be mindful of other people’s lives, instead of focusing on getting quick money. “Money is not everything. Why do you manufacture eggs using chemicals?” Imalingat asked.

How to recognize fake eggs 
In 2011, a Chinese newspaper in Shandong Province, Qilu Evening News, asked Yi Junpeng, assistant professor for biological engineering at Henan University of Science and Technology, for advice on how to identify fake eggs at market stalls. Yi warned of eggs that are too perfectly shaped and smooth. “They have an unnatural unblemished shells which are also slightly harder and shinier than real eggs.

Real eggs have a faint smell which fake eggs lack. Tapping a fake egg makes a hollower sound than a real egg. Once cracked open, egg white and yolk would quickly mix,” he said.

He also said fake eggs yolk appears more yellow and has chalaze, which is the white string that holds the yolk. In fake eggs, the egg yolk and egg white tend to mix almost instantaneously when the egg is cracked open, while in genuine eggs, the egg yolk will stay apart from the egg white for a longer time.

It will sound watery when you shake it because the chemicals inside do not solidify together.

“If you break the egg and keep it for some time, the egg white and the yolk will soon mix with one another, since they are essentially made from the same ingredients. “The fake eggs do not stink even if cooked and kept in the open for days, and do not attract ants or flies. When you fry a fake egg, the yolk will be spread without being touched unlike a real egg,” he said.

02/11/2018, 07:49 - Aunt Dora: Banange Ugandans can abuse the black off your skin. There is a war of words on FB. Sylvia Owori questioned why Barbie Itungo was invited to the panel on Geopolitics discussion oba conference. She acussed her of politicking mbu she is not one of the most influential women in Uganda. The citizens have abuse awori for 2 days  straight.
02/11/2018, 07:49 - Aunt Dora: Kyagulanyi Barbie Itungo Iam a little confused here. Are you one of the most powerful inspirational women in Uganda??? There are over 1000 women who should have rightfully been on that panel discussing Women issues. Let us not mix politics with meritocracy.
02/11/2018, 07:49 - Aunt Dora: Sylvia Owori The fact that you are not on the panel then you are not influential. Take a back sit and let Barbie shine. She is married to the most influential man in Uganda today and automatically with her wisdom she deserves to sit on that panel
02/11/2018, 07:49 - Aunt Dora: Sylvia Owori your days are long gone,how influential are you yoself🤔🤔.you were once influentual in wat we all know which was selling young naive girls to older men because of money under your defunct zipper blah blah.why are yu hell bent on attacking the younger generation that is more useful than you were??Yes she deserved to be there and she was on the panel.

#Comebeatme
02/11/2018, 07:49 - Aunt Dora: Questioning Barbie's presence on the panel is like telling the organisers that they didnt know who they needed. That is both rude & ignorant of you Miss Owori. A host has a right to choose his or her guest- basic etiquette. Dont mix politics aswell as meritocracy with the study of the effects of geography on politics and international relations(Geopolitics). Presently, she has the "global" following to have an effect women's lives.
If Mrs Barbara Itungo was invited by the French embassy, then they saw her befitting to be part of the panel. She is educated, a mother, an enterpreneur above all engages in community development with the impoverished. Most importantly she is a wife to an honourable member of parliament who is also an entertainer yet balances it all.
These invites arent about western accents and whose back a particular woman has ridden on or where one has travelled or which famous men she has dated. It is about women of substance. Barbie is a classy woman of substance who has stayed calm in the eye of the storm. Class cannot be bought. It is simply one's elegance and poise.
02/11/2018, 07:49 - Aunt Dora: Don't worry, I am sure "List of Men Slept With" wasn't one of the qualities they wanted in a panelist. If it was, am sure you would have ended up somewhere on that panel. For now, you can as well "f" off.
02/11/2018, 07:49 - Aunt Dora: Finally Sylvia has risen from the dead. Just being petty. I hope she didn't count herself among the inspirational women. The way she exploited young people to tailor for her clothes while paying them peanuts, then she could import China clothes and Shoes remove labels and replace with hers lying Ugandans mbu designer, then selling miss Uganda  contestants to the highest bidders. Please Sylvia Owori just concentrate on selling your kaftans the only thing left of your fashion brand. Mbu designer, we are tired of every person who knows how to use a sewing machine claiming to be a designer. Tumbavu.
02/11/2018, 07:49 - Aunt Dora: DEAR SYLIVIA OWORI;

My name is Ashburg Katto... If you have had your shine, why do you want to dim the light of another woman because your light is no longer shining bright or its completely put out? Why are women of yesterday pulling down fellow women of today?

Sylivia Owori, you used to be a force to reckon with, from the days of Sylivia's boutique on Wilson Street, we were in Masaka and you were the talk of Kampala. You had the most expensive boutique. Infact if anyone walked into your boutique, you used to look at them from head to toe to see if they were worth your time. You judged peoples pockets by looking at them and before they bought anything from you.

Then you went to Miss Uganda, you did so well, shined and you were on top of your game. Even when rumours were circulating around town that you were training mostly escorts instead of beauty queens, we still sniffed your name and let you shine.... (continue reading 👇) 

After many wasted years, you end up into a court battle with Nasser Sebaggala over your son Nielson Munk who was later changed the name to Adam Sebaggala. As a woman who is married to a white man, you ended up with a black child 🙆... Am sure you were so in shock that old man like Sebaggala still had live ammunitions in him. In other wards you are a married woman who sleeps around with married men. Now nyabo where do you get the audacity to talk about a fine woman like Barbie Kyagulanyi?

So you need me to remind you that you lost the court case to Sebaggala, lost the Miss Uganda franchise, African Woman Magazine closed, faded off the showbiz charts, 4-4-2 magazine closed and all you have is a lousy boutique that sells grade 10 Chinese prints?

So you desperately want a come back and you saw it fit to start attacking respected,  inspirational women like Barbie? Sylivia, Sylvia, Sylivia.....How many times have I called you? 
During your days of shining, you failed to inspire a single soul, you were running after married men, hooking up young girls with old pensioners hence nothing tangible you added onto the development of Uganda... (Akatalekeka 👇👇)

Barbie Kyagulanyi is a force to reckon with, she is Executive Director Caring Hearts Uganda, which has helped many rural girls to make reusable pads, she is a business woman running and managing One Love Beach, Busabala, an author, please google the GOLDEN MEMORIES OF A VILLAGE BELLE, its selling on Amazon and on the syllabus of Rwanda school cirriculum, a mother of 4 in the same man and on top of that a wife to the most influential man in Uganda.
Please rest your faded self and let this young woman be, let the future first lady shine, her time is NOW and she is using it right. Your time was YESTERDAY and you spent it pimping girls and running after married men..
............. Once again i remain Yours truly Mr. Ashburg Katto
02/11/2018, 09:26 - Patsy: classy ...Mrs Kyagulanyi👍🏼👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 well done...

13/11/2018, 00:37 - Aunt Dora: HURAH! A FLORIDA COURT SETS OFFICIAL ATHEIST HOLY DAY

In Florida , an atheist created a case against Easter and Passover Holy days. He hired an attorney to bring a discrimination case against Christians and Jews and observances of their holy days. The argument was that it was unfair that atheists had no such recognized days.

The case was brought before a judge. After listening to the passionate presentation by the lawyer, the judge banged his gavel declaring,
"Case dismissed!"

The lawyer immediately stood and objecting to the ruling saying,
"Your honor, How can you possibly dismiss this case? The Christians have Christmas, Easter and others.

The Jews have Passover, Yom Kippur and Hanukkah, yet my client and all other atheists have no such holidays..."

The judge leaned forward in his chair saying, "But you do. Your client, counselor, is woefully ignorant."
The lawyer said," Your Honor, we are unaware of any special observance or holiday for atheists."
The judge said, "The calendar says April 1st is April Fool’s Day.
Psalm 14:1 states, 'The fool says in his heart, there is no God.'

Thus, it is the opinion of this court, that, if your client says there is no God, then he is a fool. Therefore, April 1st is his day.

Court is adjourned..."

You gotta love a Judge that knows his scripture!

This is too good not to forward!

15/11/2018, 08:24 - Patsy: The song "It Is Well With My Soul" was written by a successful Christian lawyer Heratio Spafford. His only son died at age 4 in 1871. In 1872, the great Chicago fire wiped out his vast estate, made from a successful legal career. In 1873 he sent his wife & 4 daughters over to Europe on a summer trip on the ill fated SS Ville du Havre. Since he had a lot of work to do, he planned to follow them later. The Ship sank and he lost his 4 daughters with the wife being the only survivor. She sent him a famous telegram which simply read, "SAVED ALONE...."  On his return home, his Law firm was burned down and the insurance company refused to pay him. They said "It's an Act of God".  He had no money to pay for his house and no work, he also lost his house.  Then while sitting and thinking what's happening to him, being a spiritual person, he wrote a song - "Whatever, my Lord, You have taught me to say - It is well, it is well with my soul".  My dear friend, a good attitude will determine your altitude.  When you look at your life, career, job or family life, what do you say?  Do you praise God? Do you blame the devil?  A good attitude towards God makes Him move on your behalf.  Just sit down and say, "Today, God, it is well with my soul, I am thankful I had a peaceful sleep, I am thankful I am alive with possibilities, I am thankful I have a roof over me, I am thankful I have a job, I am thankful that I have Family and Friends.  Above all, I am thankful that I have the Lord Jesus Christ on my side."  Be blessed and don't be envious or shocked when others are prospering because you don't know what they have been through to get there (test, trials and tribulation) so thank God for what you have.  "Little is much when God is in it. It Is Well With My Soul!"

19/11/2018, 17:49 - Aunt Dora: 🦎 AVOID DEATH GET RID OF TSAKA NOW.

The slippery house lizard known as wall Gecko also called omole in Yoruba felled into a pot of soup prepared by a housewife in Nigeria unknowingly and it killed the  woman and her 9 children after eating. Another woman who cooked tea in a kettle  which the gecko felled into it all the family that drank the tea died.    Please ensure your food, cooked or raw is tightly closed as this animal is highly poisonous; it also goes with aljanus, jinns therefore do everything possible to get rid of this dangerous animal from your home. God bless u as u pass this message across to your family and friends.
Omole or Tsaka, in Hausa, Wall Gecko, is causing too much deaths at various homes these days, let it not bring death messengers to ur home. To eradicate it totally in your home, just mix salt and garlic and put it in different corners of your room. You will never see them again.
 I sent this to you, to help you and your family. Send it to people, to help them and there families...🦎
19/11/2018, 22:15 - +44 7525 475883: Thank you very much Maama D. Please don’t get rid of lizards. If they have killed anyone in Uganda I would confidently say 1 or 2 people a year. However Malaria kills lots every day. Lizards in our houses feed on mosquitoes which if unchecked can cause a catastrophe. 
That said, it’s good to be careful and cover food, even a butterfly falling in uncovered stew can cause serious food poisoning. 
*A lizard is not a dangerous animal * infact a human is proving to be more dangerous and destructive.
20/11/2018, 00:37 - Aunt Dora: Sebo I thought Geckos ( konkome) are different from other lizards (emiinya) 🤷🏿‍♀🤷🏿‍♀
20/11/2018, 03:24 - +44 7525 475883: Same things, same habitats, same feeding habits. *A lizard is not dangerous* a human is actually more dangerous. 
It’s safer to just cover food and water than to go on *getting rid of these creatures* they belong to this world just as we do and we benefit from them.

The EAC member countries have all decided to recall all passports to start using the EAC passport

Road map

9th December 2018 - start of issuing diplomatic EAC passports at a cost of 500,000

- 15th January 2019 - ordinary passports start to be issued to the public at a cost of 250,000.

- Deadline for returning all current passports in use is 15th January 2021.

- All steps involved in acquiring current passport eg signatures from LC 1 to LC 5 have been removed. You only need your national ID to acquire the new EAC passport as of 15th January 2019.

I thought I would share with you this important information from Kampala.

24/11/2018, 23:22 - Anna Christine: as if?
24/11/2018, 23:33 - Anna Christine: SAD NEWS.. 

I have confirmed that Prince David Wasajja has been rescued, rapper The Mith is still missing, singer Irene Namubiru is also missing.... About 10 people have been confirmed dead. Many more are still missing and other survivors are still stranded at Mutola Beach.

It all happened like this 👉 Revellers had organised a boat cruise party and they booked a number of artistes to perform, they invited big wigs of Kampala and many slay queens had attended. The ferry left Luzira at around 6pm and headed for Mutola Beach in Mukono... Some of the people who had paid came late and found wen the big ferry had just left. They hired a small speed boat and decided to catch up with the team.
This speed boat was knocked by unidentified object and the boat flipped upside down in the middle of the lake. Most of the people on this speedboat had no 'life jackets' some have died and others have been saved by on looking fishermen and divers who have been near. 

Please call your friend if he/she talked about a boat cruise and confirm. #KitaloNyoNyiniDdala

25/11/2018, 13:25 - Fina: Update:

30 bodies recovered so far, 26 total survived 94 missing and feared dead. 

It’s very unfortunate that we lost such a big number of Ugandans, this can be blamed on the organisers of this events, they only consider making profits than safety of fans, such a boat shouldn’t have carried 150 people, all fans are required to have life jackets to minimise the risk, there should have been at least six life savers on this boat, the boat appears too old, such a boat can be used for fishing not for parties. 

To families of those that passed away, this being a trying period strength is needed, am informed that 90% of victims are parents this is so heartening we pray for the young ones left behind. 

The UPDF AIRFORCE and Marine last night joined the search for survivors and bodies, there is no hope of recovering more survivors but loved one deserve a right to have decent burials so the target is now left to recover all bodies. 

A sad Sunday for Uganda. Rest in Peace.

26/11/2018, 11:36 - Joanna: *Arnold has requested me to post this on his behalf;*

Thanks guys for all your love,  messages of concern and most importantly your prayers,  for they did not go in vain! I am alive and safe. 

Well, several stories and versions of our tragedy have graced sitting rooms, airways and the social media. Some are total lies and some are half truths, completely distorting what actually happened... 

While on the lake and just  200m away from the shore,  the  Captain realised that the tide was high and dangerously moving towards the boat. He alerted us and requested all of us to sit down and be calm. 

He decided not to hit the tide head-on but turn the boat around and drift with it. All those stories of water slipping through, of overloading the boat are all false. In the process of turning the boat,  the tide hit us from the sides and due to its enormous speed, the boat was forced to flip on one of its sides in a rather slow gradual motion. Guys fell off as it slowly capsized. 

I fell into the water, and came back up to frightened screams and total confusion.  I decided to hold myself onto one of the boats rails under water.  I could only come up once in a while to gasp for fresh air and go back under water. I prayed and prayed to God to save me,  I repented all my sins and promised God I would live a better life henceforth! I prayed for one more chance to share my life with my kids.  

Twenty minutes or so that chance came,  an engine canoe sailed my way but it was too full. I hanged onto one of it's sides as it moved towards the shore....just like that my life was saved, but what I found at the shore was more traumatising than the time I spent under water! 

At the shore,  I found bodies lined up of people I knew,  people I had shared with jokes,  laughter, a couple of drinks and people I have broken bread with!  I could not hold myself together as I closed their eyes one by one. I couldn't believe how short this life is,  a minute is too long for one to cross over! 

Some lady had called the main land and a taxi came to pick her. I had lost my phones and could  not communicate to any one that I was safe,  save for those that had seen me at the shore.  We boarded the taxi 8 of us and headed for Mukono. Half way the trip the driver flipped and started demanding us for 50k each. We almost beat him up but later negotiated for 20k. He dropped us somewhere in Nakifuma and we boarded another taxi to Kampala. 

The rest is history, but I have learnt what it actually means to be a survivor having met death face to face! 

Folks, thanks for your prayers!

05/12/2018, 19:25 - Aunt Dora: I told BoU not to close Crane Bank but they didn’t listen to me, let them face Cosase-Museveni

By Richard Wanambwa -

	December 4, 2018

President Museveni

    

President Yoweri Museveni has told his cabinet that he tried to restrain Bank of Uganda from closing Crane Bank Limited but the failed to listen to him.

Sources say that Museveni has left the officials to be probed without protection because he told them not to close Crane Bank but they did not listen to him. Sources say this issue came up in the recent Cabinet meeting.

In a cabinet meeting yesterday that was chaired by him, Mr Museveni is reported to have rejected pleas by Finance Minister Matia Kasaija to have the ongoing inquiry in parliament halted. Kasajia’s request was supported by government Chief Whip, Ruth Nankambirwa. However, as the debate was gaining momentum, the president chipped and said “I advised those people (BoU) against closing Crane Bank, I even went on to suggest that we carryout a silent investigation and I went ahead to contact Abdu Katuntu who agreed with my suggestion but they refused and so let parliament do its work and let them face music” the president is quoted to have said.

President Museveni flatly refused to reign on Cosase so that they (BoU)are not exposed further, BoU claimed that the institution is sensitive and that its exposure will impact on the economy.

When the Bank of Uganda (BoU) sold Crane Bank to Dfcu Bank in January 2017, officials did not expect that they would be probed by parliament and so far, the Governor Prof. Emmanuel Mutebile and his subordinates have been exposed by the Auditor General John Muwanga in his special audit report of BoU on seven defunct banks.

Mr. Muwanga in his report faulted BoU for selling off some of Crane Bank’s assets and liabilities when they had chance to revive it, most especially that BoU claims it spent Shs478.8 billion on the bank during its takeover. Muwanga in his report says he doesn’t understand why BoU spent all that money on CBL and later sold it to DFCU Bank at Shs200 billion.

Parliament’s Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises (Cosase) is using Mr. Muwanga’s report to probe BoU top officials and so far they have been exposed as an institution that is disorganized in terms of writing reports, keeping documents and violation of its own operational procedures.

“I noted that BOU did not carry out a requisite valuation of assets and liabilities of the three defunct banks (GTB. NBC and CBL) resolved using the purchase and assumption arrangement at the time of signing the P&A. In absence of the valuation and or documented evaluation of alternatives and assumptions used, I could not establish how the terms for the transfer of assets and liabilities in the P&A were determined,” Muwanga’s report reads in part.

Among others Cosase is mandated to examine the reports and audited accounts of statutory authorities, corporations and public enterprises and in the context of their autonomy and efficiency, ascertain whether their operations are being managed in accordance with the required competence and where applicable, in accordance with sound business principles and prudent commercial practices.

The last weeks have seen BoU officials fail to present reports and documents concerning the dale of Teefe Trust Bank, Greenland Bank, International Credit Bank and Cooperative Bank. The officials who should be the cream of the civil service in Uganda cannot even answer simple questions related to their work. They have presented unsigned documents which they call as official as if they don’t know that any document without a signature is useless in legal terms.

Sources say Museveni is happy with Cosase that has so far exposed BoU top officials. They have been exposed as workers who handle public matters with carelessness. That is why they can’t find reports and other documents related to the sale of banks. That is why they cannot identify the whereabouts of some of the companies that they hired to do the jobs such as Kirkland & Associates and Nile River Acquisition Company.

His parents were very disappointed but still decided to put him in a catholic school. First term passed and Buruhan was the  first in the class . His parents could not believe it. They asked him how he managed to pass and he said  "when I saw  a young man nailed on the cross, i knew that these teachers don't joke with students"*

17/12/2018, 20:08 - Joanna: Like King Arthur's brave knights that frequented the round table, you are dedicated to fulfilling all your life's missions with honor and high ideals.
Your approach to both work and play is one of wholehearted involvement.
Your strong point is your ability to see the big picture without overlooking the small details- my courageous risk taker. 
Your eye for quality and lofty goals prompts you to stand up for the things you believe in.
Investigative curiosity triggers your ventures into uncharted waters (swordsman), and you are not afraid to go out on a limb in defence of an untried idea or project (mission and role are there for life-of course party changes).
You are capable of moving mountains if you avoid scattering your energies.
Your understanding is exceptionally wide ranging, because the root number nine includes the qualities of all other numbers. With a basic nature that's a combination of intellectual, creative, and spiritual qualities, you sometimes try to be all things to all people.
You care a great deal about your work, and should give you the opportunity to express your creativity and originality.
Social, charismatic, sensitive with a chivalrous heart who relishes the chance to ride in and rescue your beloveds from desperately unhappy situations and only settle down into your humdrum daily routine once the dragon is vanquished.

27/12/2018, 22:15 - Aunt Dora: Did you know there is a great difference between the word *CHRISTMAS* and the word *X-MASS*?

If not, then read the following:
👇👇👇👇👇👇👇
CHRISTMAS is combination of 2 words: *Christ* and *Mass*

Before Christ ws born Some so many years ago 25th Dec used to be PAGAN'S day for SACRIFICES.
Later in the year 533 AD Constantine the head of the then Roman Church which is today the Roman Catholic, changed the day from pagan's day of sacrifices to Jesus Christ's birth commemoration. He called the day *THE MASS FOR CHRIST* ie *CHRISTMAS*

1. CHRIST in Hebrew means *The Anointed One* or *The Chosen One*

2. MAS in Greek means *A Big Gathering of People*

 Thus CHRISTMAS means *The Gathering of Christ*

Then, where did the word *X-MASS* come from?
Be ware!! 
Its believed that after the *day of Christ's gathering* {CHRISTMAS}, became famous n respected worldwide, Atheists n Antichrists decided to change it by removing the name Christ for an *X* to mean that there is no Christ.

It changed the meaning  by reading *X-MASS* i.e to mean "there is no Christ's Gathering"
  
Therefore as a Christian don't use X-MAS but *CHRISTMAS*

The Lord bless u all who celebrated a  *Chrismas* not *X-MASS*!!
27/12/2018, 22:34 - Anna Christine: Consider it. Worthy Reading:-
*Please read* 

Ezra and Thomas joined a company together a few months after their graduation from university.
After a few years of work, their Manager promoted Ezra to a position of Senior Sales Manager, but Thomas remained in his entry level Junior Sales Officer position. Thomas developed a sense of jealousy and disgruntlement, but continued working anyway.
One day Thomas felt that he could not work with Ezra anymore. He wrote his resignation letter, but before he submitted it to the Manager, he complained that Management did not value hard working staff, but only promoted only the favoured!
The Manager knew that Ezra worked very hard for the years he had spent at the company; even harder than Thomas and therefore he deserved the promotion. So in order to help Thomas to realize this, the Manager gave Thomas a task.
“Go and find out if anyone is selling water melons in town?”
Thomas returned and said, "yes there is someone!"
The Manager asked, "how much per kg?" Thomas drove back to town to ask and then returned to inform the Manager; "they are $13.50 per kg!"
The Manager told Thomas, "I will give Ezra the same task that I gave you. Please pay close attention to his response!"
So the Manager said to Ezra, in the presence of Thomas; “Go and find out if anyone is selling water melons in town?”
Ezra went to find out and on his return he said:
"Manager, there is only one person selling water melons in the whole town. The cost is $49.00 each water melon and $32,50 for a half melon. He sells them at $13.50 per kg when sliced. He has in his stock 93 melons, each one weighing about 7kg. He has a farm and can supply us with melons for the next 4 months at a rate of 102 melons per day at $27.00 per melon; this includes delivery. 
The melons appear fresh and red with good quality, and they taste better than the ones we sold last year. 
He has his own slicing machine and is willing to slice for us free of charge.
We need to strike a deal with him before 10am tomorrow and we will be sure of beating last year's profits in melons by $223, 000.00. This will contribute positively to our overall performance as it will add a minimum of 3.78% to our current overall sales target. 
I have put this information down in writing and is available on spreadsheet. Please let me know if you need it as I can send it to you in fifteen minutes."
Thomas was very impressed and realized the difference between himself and Ezra. He decided not to resign but to learn from Ezra.
As we approach this fresh year, let this story help us keep in mind the importance of going an extra mile in all our endeavors.
You won't be rewarded for doing what you're meant to do, you only get a salary for that! You're only ​rewarded​ for going an extra mile; performing beyond expectations.
To be successful in life you must be observant, proactive and willing to do more, think more, have a more holistic perspective and go beyond the call of duty.
 *Best wishes for the holidays and the coming new Year 2019*

02/01/2019, 00:32 - Aunt Dora: President Museveni to Appoint Dr. Simon Kagugube Governor Bank of Uganda. 

Who is Dr. Simon Kagugube? 

Simon is the current Executive Director Centenary Bank, Chairman Board of Directors URA, Chairman Nation Media Group, president of the East African school of Taxation etc.

He has been Executive Director Centenary Bank for 16 years, previously he worked with the prestigious PWC (PricewaterCoopers) as Director Tax and Legal for 2 years, commissioner VAT and Income Tax URA for 6 years. 

Dr. Simon Kagugube studied from the Prestigious Yale Law School and graduated with Master of Laws (LL.M.), Doctorate in the Science of Law (JSD), Corporate Law and Taxation; Humanitarian and Refugee Law 1984 – 1989. Makerere University, Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), (Honours), Corporate Law and Taxation; Civil and Criminal Law; Law of Banking and Negotiable Instruments.
1976 – 1979

He is an advocate of the High court of Uganda.

His appointment by the president is still subject to his willingness to accept the position given his previously refusal of two appointments including that of Vice President of Uganda. The principled lawyer and banker insists he can only serve in positions that are none political for now, this means he is likely to accept this appointment since it’s a none political office.

09/01/2019, 11:48 - Aunt Dora: A lady was travelling in a train with a 6 year old kid. They both were reading books.

This seemed unbelievable to most of the fellow passengers. Then one of them got up and asked : "ma'am, in today's world the kids who were born yesterday are playing with smartphones and this kid is  reading. How come he is not playing with a phone or a tablet? How come he listens to you and how did you make him do that?"

To this the woman calmly replied :  "Sir, kids do not listen to us , they only copy us."

A small sentence... a deep meaning.

1. No traffic officer is allowed to get and keep your license, they are only allowed to get your details off it. You are not required to have a category (professional driving permit) if you are driving a vehicle for private use.
2. If you do not have your licence on you, no police officer is allowed to charge you on the spot. You should be given time to produce it (according to the law its 21 days)
3. When stopped for speeding, there is an allowance of up to 8kms above the speed limit. You should not be charged for over speeding
4. You are within your rights to ask for the calibration certificate of the radar gun used to capture your speed.
5. You are within your rights to ask for a police officer's man number, WHICH should be worn on the uniform.
6. If you feel a check point has illegally been mounted, drive to the nearest police station and handle your issues from there.
7. THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO JUMP IN YOUR CAR
Addendum:
8. Every traffic officer is required to greet you politely - they are a service not a force!
9. No traffic officer is allowed to cause undue delay to a motorist.
10. It is within the law to record a video or capture photos of your encounter with a traffic police officer.
11. You have up to 48 hours to report to the Anti-Corruption Bureau of any misconduct (eg receiving or demanding a bribe) by a traffic officer. Be sure you have evidence such as a video or photos.

16/01/2019, 20:24 - Aunt Dora: Think Like You Have No Degree Otherwise You Will Die Poor
Leader and Visionary Young Entrepreneur
After graduating, I was lucky to get a job in a bank earning 500k a month, at first I thought this was much money but after working for over 7months and I had no achievement not even a single saving, I made a hard decision to resign.
Take a decision to think like you have no degree, actually forget that you have a bachelor's degree in any discipline. That's where your story of entrepreneurship will start.
Things have changed so we must change too, Universities in the 70s used to produce 1000 graduates each year and they would get jobs even before finishing, but now each year we graduate more than 100,000 from over 30 universities and 100 institutes.
Most of the Educated people in Africa are poor not because they are dense but the way they see things just doesn't apply to the real world.
The biggest excuse for getting paid such low amounts of money and having to sit and work for another person for 30 days is THE DEGREE
This has made most of the degree holders very poor and will die that way most likely.
A degree holder does not know how to generate money even from the simplest thing unless that money is generated for the employer. He is so dependent on the salary that he can do anything to get a job but will not think of starting a business of his own to employ others not even operate a chapati Business where he can make 30k a day.
A degree holder is not prepared to start a company and grow it in 2 to 3 years but will spend 4 years searching for a job and works for 30years pushing another person's dream.
A degree holder is so eager to get out of this country and work in another country than spend time to develop his own country by creating solutions and innovations.
A degree holder will watch movies and music on his laptop all the time but never to write a book or research about business opportunities using the same laptop and make money.
They spend much on airtime and data calling and charting with friends about football, music, outings, but never for business
A degree holder will blame the government for lack of jobs even when he was on government bursary for him to have his degree.
Why are the degree holders poor?
Because they have decided to pride themselves in a degree and failed to think better than a man who does not have even a certificate to his name.
If you want to progress, throw away that degree and start thinking better than someone without a degree. Have an open mind and start anything that can make you money.
Be prepared to work extra hard - work like an ox for your business.

17/01/2019, 21:22 - Aunt Dora: Thanks my dears🤗🤗
17/01/2019, 21:31 - Aunt Dora: Dear all,

Thought it would be good to share this with everyone, we need to be extra careful.

This is very scary and could happen to any of us. Seems like every nice thing people do for one another can be perverted. A new twist on kidnapping from a very smart survivor:

About a week ago there was a woman standing by the Uchumi entrance in Garden City, this woman had finished shopping, went out to her car and discovered that she had a flat tyre.

She got the jack out of the trunk and began to change the flat tyre. A nice man dressed in a business suit and carrying a briefcase walked up to her and said, "I noticed you're changing a flat tyre.

Would you like me to take care of it for you?" The woman was grateful for his offer and accepted his help.

They chatted amiably while the man changed the tyre, and then put the flat tyre and the jack in the boot, shut it and dusted his hands off.

The woman thanked him profusely, and as she was about to get in her car, the man told her that he left his car around at The Oasis Mall , and asked if she would mind giving him a lift to his car.

She was a little surprised and she asked him why his car was at The Oasis Mall .

He said that he left his car because of a traffic Jam, and now he was running late. The woman hated to tell him "no" because he had just rescued her from having to change her flat tire all by herself, but she felt uneasy. (Trust that gut feeling!)

Then she remembered seeing the man put his briefcase in her boot before shutting it and before he asked her for a ride to his car.

She told him that she'd be happy to drive him around to his car, but she just remembered one last thing she needed to buy. (Smart woman!!)

She said she would only be a few minutes; he could sit down in her car and wait for her; she would be as quick as she could be.

She hurried into the mall, and told a security guard! what had happened, the guard came out to her car with her, but the man had left. They opened the trunk, took out his locked briefcase and took it down to the police station.

The police opened it (ostensibly to look for ID so they could return it to the man). What they found was rope, duct tape, and knives. When the police checked her "flat" tire, there was nothing wrong with it; the air had simply been let out. It was obvious what the man's intention was, and obvious that he had carefully thought it out in advance. The woman was blessed to have escaped harm.

How much worse it would have been if she had children with her and had them wait in the car while the man fixed the tire, or if she had a baby strapped into a car seat? Or if she'd gone against her judgment and given him a lift?

I'd like you to forward this to all those you know that may need to be reminded that the world we live in has a lot of deviants in it. It may save a life. Better to be safe than sorry.

18/01/2019, 16:56 - Joanna: Somebody called me with this phone number 07060714545 telling me he was doing some registration online and he mistakenly put my number on what he was registering, that my number is similar to his number and that the password of what he was registering was sent to my phone which I actually saw as 6310.
He was now appealing to me to give him the reset code that was sent to my phone so that he could finish his registration. I told him to call me with the number he claimed was similar to mine so that I could verify his claim, he told me he didn't have credit in that line.
I got online to find out more, only to discover he was actually trying to reset my bank online/yahoomail password and that he is a fraudster, an account hacker and also a 419er. If I had given him the code which was sent to my phone, he would have used it to reset my bank online/mobile app account.
Please let us be careful and vigilant. Fraudsters are devising new ways every day.
This is a new way of defrauding people...
Share to prevent others from being defrauded.

01/02/2019, 00:56 - Aunt Dora: 3 BENEFITS OF CIGARETTES!!!

1. Smokers don't grow old!

2.Smokers can not be bitten by a dog!!

3. Smokers cannot be attacked by thieves while sleeping.

WHY NOT?
1. Smokers don't grow old because they will die young due to lungs damage, as warned by the Ministry of  Health.

2.Smokers won't be bitten by a dog simply because when their lungs are damaged they have to walk with a stick every time. And dogs fear people with a stick in their hands.

3.Thieves cant break into the house of a smoker at night because smokers are always awake coughing!

If you like these three benefits, keep smoking or start smoking!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

May be we meet physically on a Saturday and pray together, or someone leads us in prayer daily for some days, your thoughts? Additions, subtractions... 

I know its a matter of faith and everyone's heart. I was just thinking that doing it jointly in numbers really narrows down our battle ground.

07/02/2019, 19:27 - Aunt Dora: What a speech Pope Francis gave in yesterday's homily / sermon! 

READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN:

*You can have flaws, be anxious, and even be angry, but do not forget that your life is the greatest enterprise in the world. Only you can stop it from going bust. Many appreciate you, admire you and love you. Remember that to be happy is not to have a sky without a storm, a road without accidents, work without fatigue, relationships without disappointments. To be happy is to find strength in forgiveness, hope in battles, security in the stage of fear, love in discord. It is not only to enjoy the smile, but also to reflect on the sadness. It is not only to celebrate the successes, but to learn lessons from the failures. It is not only to feel happy with the applause, but to be happy in anonymity. Being happy is not a fatality of destiny, but an achievement for those who can travel within themselves. To be happy is to stop feeling like a victim and become your destiny's author. It is to cross deserts, yet to be able to find an oasis in the depths of our soul. It is to thank God for every morning, for the miracle of life. Being happy is not being afraid of your own feelings. It's to be able to talk about you. It is having the courage to hear a "no". It is confidence in the face of criticism, even when unjustified. It is to kiss your children, pamper your parents, to live poetic moments with friends, even when they hurt us. To be happy is to let live the creature that lives in each of us, free, joyful and simple. It is to have maturity to be able to say: "I made mistakes". It is to have the courage to say "I am sorry". It is to have the sensitivity to say, "I need you". It is to have the ability to say "I love you". May your life become a garden of opportunities for happiness ... That in spring may it be a lover of joy. In winter a lover of wisdom. And when you make a mistake, start all over again. For only then will you be in love with life. You will find that to be happy is not to have a perfect life. But use the tears to irrigate tolerance. Use your losses to train patience. Use your mistakes to sculptor serenity. Use pain to plaster pleasure. Use obstacles to open windows of intelligence. Never give up .... Never give up on people who love you. Never give up on happiness, for life is an incredible show.*
(Pope Francis).

12/02/2019, 15:50 - Irene Nakalembe: Dear Family 2.5 years ago i was diagnosed with a growth in my lungs and other things I’m not yet comfortable sharing.
I sulked and cried who wouldn’t! And yet my new born Liam depended on me so I decided to seek solutions. I started to research; I’m trying piece together all I’ve read about trust me the information is out there but in light of all that’s happening in our family and the multiple diagnoses around us I thought I’d share we all have the same blood.
A very large percentage of the diagnoses we have are due to high inflammatory process in our bodies, I do not know why we are susceptible to this I’m uncertain based off of various people’s research the reason why some people have high inflammation and others do not! 
Some things that I have incorporated are to adhere to an anti inflammatory diet .... wicked hard for me if u know me u know how much I love meat, I still struggle. Drinking teas with anti inflammatory properties turmeric tea, ginger, cadarmom. I do not have all the answers but the imaging I’ve had to date suggests a narrowing of these growths in my body. 
I share this because the health system in Uganda  have the luxury of little to no cost imaging and usually if u have an inflammatory disorder you’ll only find out when it has led to a great decline in other things and caused you bigger problems. We are all different; please do your own research, eat as close to vegan or maybe pescatarian as possible and use the wealth of nature and natural paths that Uganda has. Feel free to ask me any questions, I’m on a learning journey as well may not have all the answers but let’s find them together.
Love Irene Nakalembe
12/02/2019, 15:56 - Tina, Kerbi: True. I too suffer inflammatory challenges and these remedies actually help and have kept me off the ruthless medications presented to me over 8years back.
Thanks for sharing Irene

12/02/2019, 22:57 - Joanna: The art of communication is not mastered by just knowing what to say and how to say it but when to say it like now.. when health is at the realm of everything. Thank you.

Read your note and decided 'll post later because of the noise in my environment.

The environment was too loud and the whatsapp note was 'jabbing hard at me like one of those #metoo campaigns or #survivingGundikellythings... because its an actual health call or #metoobeenkindathere. Do men get these inflammation things kinda bells?

 John 7:38
 *Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them."*

A flowing river is a source of life and it will carry away all the chaff. Otherwise stagnant water is breeding ground for mosquitoes and other bacteria that cause disease and death, and actually stinks with time!

*PRAYER:* 
Almighty God, there is no God like you. We pray that the power of the Holy Spirit will be our guide and that we will be a source of flowing living waters that will cleanse us and make us free from the bondage of the devil. In Jesus' name we pray, Amen!

*Have a blessed weekend.*

 *We love because He first loved us.*

God's love is the source of all human love and it spreads like fire. In loving his children, God kindles a flame in their hearts. 
In turn, they love others, who are warmed by God's love through them.

*PRAYER:* 
Almighty God, we thank you for your unconditional love to us. We pray that you teach us to truly love our "neighbors" as we love ourselves so that peace may prevail throughout the whole world. In Jesus' name we pray with thanksgiving, Amen!

*Have a lovely Week.*

27/02/2019, 08:36 - John Thomas: *Good Morning*

 Leviticus 26:13
*I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt so that you would no longer be slaves to the Egyptians; I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk with heads held high.*

Imagine the joy of a slave being set free!
We too are set free when we accept Christ's payment that redeems us from sin's slavery .
Once we have confessed and repented of all our sins, let us not be bogged down in shame over our past sins, but also entrust our lives to God so that we don't return to our former sinful patterns.

*PRAYER:* 
You are a mighty God and your mercies are new every morning. Thank you for forgiving all our sins and making us new creatures and for never putting us to the shame that we deserve. We pray that you hold us by the right hand and guide our footsteps so that we don't walk back into the slavery of sin and put your name to shame. In Jesus' name we pray, Amen!

*God bless you.*

27/02/2019, 16:58 - Aunt Dora: "LADIES DRESS DECENTLY"
One young lady arrived at a meeting wearing
clothes that were quite revealing her body parts.
Here is what the Boss told her:
He took a good look at her and made her sit.
Then he said something she will never
forget in her whole life.
He looked at her straight in the eyes and
said;
"Lady, everything that God made is valuable in
this world, is well covered and hardly to see, hardly
to find and hardly to get...
<·/*\·>
<·/*\·> Where do you find DIAMONDS??... Deep
down in
the ground, covered and protected.
<·/*\·>
<·/*\·> Where do you find the Biggest PHILIPPINE
PEARLS??...
Deep down at the bottom of the Palawan Ocean,
covered up and protected
in a beautiful shell.
<·/*\·>
<·/*\·> Where do you find GOLD??...
Way down in the
MINE, covered over with layers of rock and to
get them, you have to work hard and dig deep
down to get them. RIGHT??...
<·/*\·>
.
He looked at her with serious eyes and said;
"Your BODY is SACRED and UNIQUE"
You are far more precious than DIAMONDS,
PEARLS
and GOLD, and your body should be well covered
too.
"So, he added if you keep your TREASURED
MINERAL just like diamonds, pearls, and gold
deeply covered up, a REPUTABLE mining
organization with the requisite machinery will
fly down and conduct YEARS of EXTENSIVE
EXPLORATION...
.
First, they will contact your government
{FAMILY},
sign professional contracts {WEDDING}
and mine you professionally { LEGAL MARRIAGE}
But if you leave your PRECIOUS MINERALS
uncovered on the SURFACE of the EARTH, you
always attract a lot of ILLEGAL MINERS to come
and mine you illegally.
Everybody will just pick up their CRUDE
INSTRUMENT and just have a dig on you just
freely like that.
.
Keep your bodies DEEPLY COVERED so that it
INVITE PROFESSIONAL miners to chase you...
Let us ALL ENCOURAGE our SISTERS,
DAUGHTERS,WIVES, and FRIENDS
to DRESS WELL DECENTLY...
AM I TALKING SENSE?

 *YOU CANNOT BE USELESS!*

 _‘I can’t take it any more...I feel hopeless…Useless…Tired…Worthless…So much pain.’_—This is a painful state of the mind that can easily culminate in suicide. 

Some days you might feel like you have lost all your strength. That the world could go on perfectly fine without you but NEVER FORGET that You are loved and wanted by a God bigger than the entire universe.

 *GREAT TRUTHS:* 

1⃣	_Self-pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it, we can never do anything wise in this world.—Helen Keller_

 2⃣ _Self-pity is like a snake that gets in your brain and lays its eggs there.—Steve Chandler_

 *FACT:*

 *_It is the Lord who goes before you; He will be with you. He will not fail you or abandon you. Do not fear or be dismayed.”—Deuteronomy 31:8 AMP_* 

When you are feeling lonely, anxious, or depressed look to our Heavenly Father, for He will give you the strength you need to keep going. God planned you. Nobody else can be like you. Nobody else can do what you do. Grasp this. Embrace it. God is not a duplicator. He is a Creator. You are absolutely perfect and genetically accurate for solving a specific problem for somebody on earth...you are their reward! Hold your head high and lift your hand to Him. He will grasp you.

 Be blessed.

05/03/2019, 12:12 - John Thomas: A  MUST READ.

A very poor newly wedded, young couple lived in a small farm. One day the husband made the following proposal to his wife:

Honey, I will leave the house: I will travel faraway, get a job and work hard in order to come back and give you the comfortable life that you deserve. I do not know how long I will stay away, I only ask one thing, please wait for me, and while I am away, you should be faithful to me, because I will be faithful to you. His wife agreed, so the young man left. He walked many days until he found a farmer who was in need of someone to help him. The young man offered his services. He was accepted. Therefore he discussed the terms with his boss:

Let me work for as long as I want and when I think I should go home, please relieve me of my duties. I do not want to receive my salary. I ask you to save it for me, until the day I leave. The day I decide to go, please give me the money and I will go my way. They agreed on that. So, the young man worked for twenty years without holiday and without rest. After twenty years, he came to his boss and said:

Boss, I want my money, because I am returning to my home. The boss replied:

All right, after all, I made a deal with you and I will stick to it. However, before you go I want to offer you something new: I will give you all your money and send you away; or I will give you 3 pieces of advice and send you away. If I give you money, you lose the 3 pieces of advice. If I give you the 3 pieces of advice, you lose the money. Now, go to your room and think about your answer. He thought for two days. Then he went to the boss and told him:

I want the 3 pieces of advice. The boss stressed again, if I give you the 3 pieces of advice, I will not give you the money, and the man replied:

I want the 3 pieces of advice. 

The boss then told him:

No. 1: Never take shortcuts in your life, shorter and unknown paths can cost your life. No. 2: Never be too curious, for curiosity towards evil can be deadly. No. 3: Never make decisions in moments of anger or pain, because when you repent, it could be too late. After giving these 3 pieces of advice, the boss said to him:
Here, you have 3 loaves of bread, 2 are for you to eat during the journey and the last is for you to eat with your wife when you get home. So, the man went his way, after twenty years away from home and from his wife, whom he loved so much. After the first day of travel, he found a man who greeted him and asked:

Where are you going? 

He replied:
To a distant place which is about 20 days away if I continue walking. The man said to him:
Ol' boy, this path is too long! I know a shortcut that is very safe and you will arrive in 5 days only. The man began to follow the path suggested until he remembered the first piece of advice. Then, he returned and followed the long path. Days later he learned that the shortcut led to an ambush.

After a few more days of travel, he found an inn by the roadside, where he could rest. He paid for a room and after taking a bath he lay down to sleep. During the night he woke up as he heard a terrifying scream. He rose to his feet and went to the door to check what happened. As he was opening the door, he remembered the second piece of advice. Therefore he returned, lay down again and slept. At dawn, after breakfast, the owner of the lodging asked him if he had not heard the scream at night. He affirmed that he heard. Then, the host said:
Were you not curious to see what happened? And he replied:

No, I was not. 

Then the host said:

You are the first guest to leave this inn alive. My neighbour is completely crazy. He usually shouts at night to call someone’s attention. When some of the guests come out, he kills them and buries their bodies in the backyard. The man continued his long journey, eager to arrive soon.

After many days and nights walking, he was very tired, but he finally saw his house far away. It was night. He saw some light coming out of the window of his house and was able to see the silhouette of his wife. But he also saw that she was not alone. He came closer and saw there was a man with her. She softly caressed his hair. When he saw that scene, his heart was filled with hatred and bitterness. He decided to rush at and kill them both mercilessly. However, he took a deep breath and he remembered the third piece of advice. Then he stopped, reflected and decided to sleep outside that night. He slept in the midst of the bushes, determined to make a decision the next day. At dawn, he was calmer and thought:
I will not kill my wife and her lover. I am going back to my boss to ask him to take me back. But before I go, I want to tell my wife that I have always been faithful to her.

He went to the front door and knocked. When his wife opened the door and recognized him, she cried and embraced him warmly. He tried to push her away, but he
was not able. Then, with tears in his eyes he told her:

I was faithful to you but you betrayed me.
She was shocked, so she replied:
How did I betray you? I have never betrayed you. I waited patiently for you for twenty good years. Then he asked:

How about the man that you were caressing yesterday? 

And she said:

That man is your son. When you left, I discovered I was pregnant. Today he is twenty years old. Hearing that, the man asked her forgiveness. He met and hugged his son. Then he told them all the things he had experienced while away. Meanwhile, his wife prepared some coffee for them to eat together, the last bread given by his boss. 

After a prayer of thanksgiving, he broke the bread. When he looked at it, he found all his money inside. In fact, there was even more than the right payment for his twenty years of dedication and hard work.

Friends, our God is like this boss. When he asks us to make a sacrifice, he wants to give us more than what we give Him. He wants us to have His unique wisdom as well as the
material blessings. Someone sent this piece to me and it blessed me and I shared it to you. also share with others ...

09/03/2019, 23:46 - Aunt Dora: URGENT: SNAKE BITE (First Aid)

If someone is bitten by a snake do not lament, get/  the tender/young shoots of *cassava* leaves.  Let the person chew them and swallow the juice.
Go to the medical facility for medical attention soon after doing that.  The medical attention is always important.

The juice will neutralize the venom of the snake and reduce the risk of death. 

SHARE. YOU NEVER KNOW. You may save a life.

*QUOTE OF THE DAY* 

Your attitude will determine your altitude; how you see the problem is the problem!

 When Goliath roared against Israel there were 40000 soldiers who could have gone to battle but they saw the giant and said " he is too big to whip but David saw him and said he is too big to miss; one problem two perceptions. The one with the right perception took the day (Num 14:28).

*Prayer:*
Lord, we thank you that when we have you in our lives, even when we have nothing else, we have everything yet when we have everything else but without you, we have nothing.
We pray that we will keep our eyes on you and appreciate your omnipotence to accomplish what concerns us everyday. In the name of Jesus Christ we pray, Amen.

 *God bless you.*

1 Samuel 17:33
 *Saul replied, "You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a young man, and he has been a warrior from his youth."*

Have you been left out; not seen fit for battle?
May be you are also left out, not accepted or appreciated by your own people or by others!
You need not worry about it as long as you have a right relationship with God as David did!

*PRAYER:* 
Almighty God, we present ourselves to you, repenting all our sins and asking for your forgiveness. You are the only one who does great and mighty things through us. We pray that you uplift us and lead us  to victory in the different challenges we are faced. In the name of  your son Jesus Christ, Amen!

*God bless you.*

26/03/2019, 09:35 - John Thomas: *Good Morning*

Psalm 121:6  *The sun shall not burn you by day, nor the moon by night.*

This is an assurance from God that His watch over us is constantly with us! Moment by moment, He keeps us safe from all harm that we know or never get to know at all.

He knows us more than we know ourselves and always knows the end of anything from its beggining! 
He is worth trusting. Will you trust Him every moment for the best in your life?

*Prayer:*

Gracious Father, we thank you for your thoughts towards us. 
We are very sure they are the best for us and we pray that we will live according to your will always. 
In Jesus' precious name we pray, Amen.

*Have a blessed Tuesday.*

Psalm 121:1-2  *I look to the mountains; where* *will my help come from?*My help will come from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.*

It is common, humanly speaking, to seek for help from physical things or what can be seen or work round our problems in human wisdom or perception!

Even as believers, God can be forgotten in our equations of solution. Just like it is in our everyday life, the maker or manufacturer understands their product better than anyother and can fix any problem in them faster and perfectly!

If that is possible with mortal man, it gets better with our immortal God, our maker who is Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent, and is therefore more than able to sort us out with any help needed!

*Prayer:*
Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you that we are your creation that you love and wish well.
We pray and believe that we are safest in you and commit to always seek your help who understands us best.
In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.

*Stay blessed.*
29/03/2019, 10:59 - John Thomas: *Good Morning*

*Keep On Keeping On*

There are times in your life when you feel like you’ve hit a rut. Everything that could go wrong—does go wrong! And just when you think you might be getting ahead, you get slapped down. 

This can be downright discouraging for anyone. It’s human nature to throw your hands up in the air and be tempted to just give up. But instead of being a quitter—fight harder, armed with the full armor of God! 

Keep putting one foot in front of the other and just go forward! The Bible says in James 1:12 (NIV), “Blessed is the one who perseveres . . .”, so choose to be victorious in Jesus, not a victim of the enemy. When Satan tries to pull you down into the dark pit of discouragement, call out loud, “Jesus, save me!” and immediately you will feel God’s presence lifting you up into His arms of safety. 

Instead of wallowing in despair, focus on what God can do through you—not what you can’t do! Staying in the fight builds character and makes you stronger. 

The trials you experience here on earth will prepare you for eternity. Remember, you’re not fighting this battle alone. No matter what, refuse to give up and just—keep on keeping on . . . with Jesus! Texts: Isaiah 40:31, 2 Chronicles 15:7, Hebrews 12:1-3, 1 Corinthians 16:13, James 1:12

Nana Kagga

On Thursday night I was attacked in an Uber a friend of mine Acaye Elizabeth Pamela and I picked up after a night out. 
Thank you all who have reached out and called me although I have not been able to respond to every one as I recover from the physical damage to my face and body.
To those who use UBER please read Acaye's account of what happened to us below:

ALERT! ALERT! UBER DRIVERS ARE BRUTALISING AND MAKING VICTIMS OF THEIR CLIENTELE. AVOID, BOYCOT UBER TAXIS UNTIL THEY CAN ENSURE OUR SAFETY.
Context: 
on friday 29th March at Approximately 1:00 am, and myself ordered an UBER taxi through Omara Daniel Pkwiiyulli phone from 110 0n seventh. 
immediately we got in, the driver proceeded to turn on a video of kakande;  allegedly performing miracles. 
I politely asked him to turn it off and replay it when we have exited his taxi. He acted deaf until Nana reiterated the same. 
Then, he proceeded to deliberately drive the car at snail speed on a traffic-less morning.
 Again, I raised my concern. Again, he acted deaf untill Nana assured him of her knowledge of their taxis to slow the drive and charge more. 
He acts irritated and announces that we are not his ideal customers and that he will not continue the ride. 
At this point, we are just at the T-junction from Nawmongo  that opens immediately on seventh street. 
but, he does not stop. 
instead, he increases the speed a little bit and deliberately goes and parks the taxi in that alley at the corner that leads into and out of Namuwongo area . 
A  notorious Rape, Murder and Robbery Corner. 
I am at this point negotiating with him to kindly return us back to where he picked us up from, less than 300 meters away and end the ride. 
He is threatening to beat us and do all manner of harm to us at this point. 
I step out of the car, in time to see him dial a number on his phone.He opens his boot and brings out a sinister looking coiling wire which he starts to brandish. Nana is having none of this and calls to question his alleged love for Christ and joke of an attempt to evangelise us. 
Another car , posing as a random taxi cab appears from the Namwongo area. he parks in front of this car. They exchange a quick look. He asks whats going on. 
I tell him this driver is attempting to hassle us and is now threatening violence. At this point, there is a building confrontation between Nana and this monster. The new driver proceeds to carry Nana towards his car -abduction style. 
I am at this point backing away from the other monster, a safe distance away, I see nana slouched against this other monsters car tyre. she is muttering " oh my God, Oh my God!"
The new monster is stating
" How dare you dare to fight me back! you are a woman. how dare you insult me! you are a woman!"(this is verbatim)
Quickly, i go lead Nana away, but he is not finished. 
Men are starting to gather at this point from the shanty town along the railway line. However, they are silently watching. As if in a trance, simply inching closer to us.
The second monster removes a Nkoni from his car. Yes,  a nkoni  and begins flogging Nana. I step in to intervene between attempts at negotiation. But not in time to prevent this herdsman's rod from connecting with the side of Nana's face. 
She begins to shut down. I heard something pop. She states in that moment that she thinks something has broken in her ear. These monsters immediately enter their cars and speed away. 
The Response: 
According to Daniel, his ride info indicated that we were driving around Bugolobi for more than an hour .
Uber, erased the ride from their system when Daniel reported. But he had already documented the ride and phonecalls. 
The matter is before the police. 
The very next night, someone close to us was almost attacked in a similar way by another Uber driver. she jumped out of the car in time. Another guy is still hospitalised from an Uber attack.
There are many similar reports circulating of being attacked by Uber drivers.
 Dear Ugandans, let us boycott them untill they can guarantee our safety. 
AcayeSpeaking.

 Numbers 16:13
*Isn’t it enough that you have brought us up out of Egypt, a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in this wilderness,  and that now you treat us like your subjects*

One of the easiest ways to fall away from following God is to look at our present problems and exaggerate them!

*PRAYER:* 
Almighty God, we thank you for ever being present in our times of sorrow and joy.
We pray that you give us the grace not to focus on our problems, which may hinder our relationship with You, but that we surrender all our challenges to You. In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.

*Have a blessed Thursday.*

07/04/2019, 16:33 - John Thomas: I was invited to a wedding, when I reached the hotel I found two doors written

1 . Bride's guests
2. Groom's guests

I entered the one written Bride guests and found two more doors

1 . Ladies
2. Men

I went through the one for men only to find two more doors

1. Guest with gift
2. Guest without gift

I went through the one written 'Guests without Gifts' and found myself outside the hotel through the back door. At the door was written
"So in this time of hard economy you want to just come, eat and drink without any gift, no way". Bye👋🏻". 

Don't laugh alone,  please share 😂😂😂😂

Luke 22:47
*While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,*

A kiss was and is still the traditional greeting among men in certain parts of the world. In this case, it was also the agreed upon signal to point out Jesus!

It is ironic that a gesture of greeting would be the means of betrayal; this makes it a hollow gesture!

*PRAYER:* 
Almighty God, we thank you for the gift of life and pray that we may have religious practices that are not simply empty gestures. May we also not  betray You by acts of service or giving that are carried out merely for a public show. May our acts of service or giving be sincere and to the glorification of Your name, Amen.

*God bless you.*

In a special way I thank you Lord for Julie who called to check on me in worry! Oh Lord I think its about time I created a call tree like in the bank of who calls who during such disasters.

04/05/2019, 13:17 - John Thomas: *Good Morning*

 Matthew 23:3
 *So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.,*

 Sadly this verse applies to many of us in leadership or any other position in society that makes us influence the behavior of others; such as *teachers, pastors, office managers, political leaders, parents*...  

Let us always practice what we preach, teach or follow the norms, otherwise we shall only be acting as sign posts, which have never reached and will never reach where they are directing people to go!

*PRAYER:*
Almighty God thank you for your mercies that are new every morning; otherwise we would not be a able to stand  before you. We pray that  you teach us your ways and may we strive to lead and live a life that glorifies your name, in the name of God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit we pray, Amen.

*God bless you.*
07/05/2019, 09:17 - John Thomas: *Good Morning*

Psalm 27:13
*I am still confident of this: l will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.'*

Where would we be if we did not believe we would experience God's favour?
Without this knowledge we would be utterly hopeless!
But since  we expect His goodness , His mercy and His grace in our lives,
we should not despair, rather believe and live with confident expectation that our Father in heaven will carry us through all the storms in life.

*PRAYER:*
Lord Jesus , thank You for the wonderful things that You have planned and prepared for us. We will believe in Your goodness towards us no matter what we may be facing. In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.

*Have a blessed day.*
07/05/2019, 11:19 - Tina, Kerbi: Amen.

May your passive income multiply(income that works for you without requiring your real time input)

May you Google or YouTube the topic passive income.  

Ideas for passive income include start a you tube channel... invest in shares or the stock market...start a website, sell some stuff on Amazon. Okay some of this appears hard but try.  I'm going to try too. Youtube is your easiest bait y'all android phone users. Good luck.

11/05/2019, 13:20 - John Thomas: A Professor started his class on a very serious Topic. The moment he turned towards the blackboard, one of the students whistled. 

He turned, looked at the class and asked the Whistler's name. No one answered.

The Professor peacefully kept the Pen in his pocket saying: "Lecture ends here. I'll tell you a story to utilise the remaining time".
Everyone became interested.

"Yesterday night I tried hard to sleep, but it was miles away from my eyes, so I thought I'd better get petrol in my car, which will save my time next morning and might induce sleep. 

After having my tank full, I started roaming in that area, enjoying the
peace of a traffic free ride.

Suddenly, on the corner I saw a girl who was as young and beautiful as the clothes she was wearing. Must have been returning from a party.
 
Out of courtesy, I turned my car towards her and asked if I may be of any help. She asked me if I could
drop her to her home, she'll be very obliged, to which I agreed.

She sat in the front seat with me. We started talking, and to my amazement she was very intelligent, had control on many topics which many youngsters don't.

When we reached her address, she admitted my courteous nature and behavior and accepted that she had fallen in love with me.

I also admitted her intelligence and beauty and that I've also started liking her. I told her about my job
as a professor in the university.

The girl asked my number, which I gave her willingly. Then she asked me a favor, to which i couldn't have denied naturally.

She said that her brother is a student in the same university, and asked me to take care of him, since we'll be in a long relationship now.

I asked the name of the student. She said that I'll recognise him with one of his very prominent quality, He whistles a lot!

All eyes in the classroom turned towards the boy who had whistled.

The professor said: 
"I didn't buy my Ph.D in Psychology...
I earned it.” Oya! Come out you stupid fool"

04/06/2019, 09:36 - Kate: *KICK DECIET OUT OF YOUR LIPS IF YOU MUST LIVE A LIFE OF INTEGRITY*

Deceit is one sure way of identifying a person who lacks integrity. A person of integrity will stand for truth and will speak the truth no matter what it might cost them.

Today, when it comes to sin, we categorize it on a weighing scale. We make alarm for some while we take others as a usual thing done daily. However, we must understand that God looks at all sins as sin. None is sin above the other. When someone commits adultery or murder, and another tells lies, they have all committed sin and in the eyes of God, none is a small sinner. 

We have been raised in societies that lack spiritual morals where lying is the order of the day. Husbands lie to wives, and so do wives to keep their marriage going. Shepherds lie to the sheep and so does the sheep.  Parents lie to their children and so do children, teachers lie to students and so do students. Employers lie to their employees to keep the company going.  Leaders lie to their followers, to be submissive to them. It’s a vicious circle of deceit.

Sometimes we use lies as a means of getting what we what and then excuse ourselves of hardships in the economy, political issues, that is how I would get to where I wanted. It is the only way I would protect my marriage. It was easier to lie so I would have him propose to me. I needed a job to fend for my children and had no option but to lie. I needed a visa to travel to USA.

Many people have accumulated a lot of wealth through deceit. Others have got into marriages because at one point they had to lie. Others have got citizenship of other countries only because they had to fake some stories to go through it. Women are forging sickness on their children because that is the only way a man would give her money. Others are escaping to pay taxes by forging documents. Many are calling themselves widows, orphans because by so doing, they can win sympathy of sponsors. Etc!

This is the bitter shock behind many peoples success; But we must not forget that God hates lying. Proverbs 6 verses 16-19 lists seven things God hates, and it’s worth noting that two of them refer to dishonesty: _*“There are six things the Lord hates no, seven things he detests: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that kill the innocent, a heart that plots evil, feet that race to do wrong, a false witness who pours out lies, a person who sows discord in a family.”_*

Therefore God cannot stand with us to protect whatever we got through deceit. The Bible says in Isaiah 54:14 _*‘’In righteousness you will be established: Tyranny will be far from you; you will have nothing to fear. Terror will be far removed; it will not come near you.’’*_ So if we use a crooked way to succeed,  the end might not be that good.

Because the Devil is the originator of deception there is no single lie that we will speak that will not be found. Shockingly, we might even be dead already, but it will catch up with our children. Why? Because lies are for the devil and the same devil who inspires us to lie, will use the same route to expose us.

In John 8:44, Jesus says the following of the devil, "He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies." Not only does the devil deceive, He is the father of deception.

If we must live a life of INTEGRITY, let us speak nothing but the truth all the time. It does not matter where truth will take us but speaking it will save us from a lot of troubles and shame. Not forgetting to remind ourselves that speaking the truth and knowing the truth shall always set us free from the chains of the enemy. We are not in this world to impress people, if we must get something through deceit, it is much better not to get it.

By the grace of God, speaking the truth is very possible through Jesus Christ, and so we are able to aim towards true integrity for ourselves.

"Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but he who makes his ways crooked will be found out." Proverbs 10:9

11/06/2019, 20:24 - Kate: Several years ago, a Pastor from out-of-town accepted a call to a town to propagate Christianity. Some weeks after he arrived, he had an occasion to ride a bus from his home to the downtown area. When he sat down, he discovered that the driver had accidentally given him 50 pence above his normal change. As he considered what to do, he thought to himself, 'You'd better give this money back. It would be wrong to keep it. Then another thought occur to him, "Oh, forget it, it's only 50p; who would worry about this little amount? Anyway, the bus company gets too much fare; they will never miss it. Accept it as a 'gift from God' and keep quiet."When his stop came, he paused momentarily at the door, and then he handed the 50p to the driver and said,'Hear, you gave me too much change.' The driver, with a smile, replied,'Aren't you the new Pastor in town?' 'Yes' he replied.'Well, I have been thinking a lot lately about accepting Jesus. I just wanted to see what you would do if I gave you too much change. I'll see you in the Church this Sunday. When the Pastor stepped off the bus, he literally grabbed the nearest light pole, held on, and said, 'Oh God, I almost sold Christianity for 50 pence. 'Our lives are the Holy Bible some people will ever read. This is a really scary example of how much people watch us as Christians, and will put us to the test! Always be on guard -- and remember -- You carry the name of Christ on your shoulders when you call yourself 'Christians. 'Watch your thoughts; they become words. Watch your words; they become actions. Watch your actions; they become habits. Watch your habits; they become character. Watch your character; it becomes your destiny. I'm glad a friend forwarded this to me as a reminder and I chose to forward it to you. If you don't pass this on to anybody, nothing bad will happen to u; but, if you do, you would have reminded someone today of his/her responsibility as a Christian and God will bless you abundantly.


Plz do not stop.
Forward to all Christians

18/06/2019, 18:29 - Aunt Dora: CIVIL WAYS TO COMMUNICATE

1. Instead of saying you are lying say THIS IS NOT TRUE

2. Instead of saying this post is fake say ARE YOU SURE OF THIS?

3. Instead of saying you are wrong say THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE 

4. Instead of saying you will be punished say THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO THIS

5. Instead of saying I am talking and you are not paying attention say I WILL LIKE TO GET YOUR ATTENTION

6. Instead of saying I don't have your time say I WILL LIKE TO END THE CONVERSATION NOW

7. Instead of saying what you are saying does not make sense say IS THERE ANY OTHER OPTION THAN THIS?

8. Instead of saying what you are doing is bad say THIS BEHAVIOR IS INAPPROPRIATE

9.Instead of saying this child is a slow learner say THIS CHILD IS AN UPCOMING LEARNER

10. Instead of saying " get out from here" say PLEASE IT WILL BE APPRECIATED YOU LEAVE THIS PLACE.

SOME SOCIAL RULES THAT MAY HELP YOU:

1. Don’t call someone more than twice continuously. If they don’t pick up your call, presume they have something important to attend to;

2. Return money that you have borrowed even before the other person remembers lending it to you. It shows your integrity and character. Same goes with umbrellas, pens and lunch boxes;

3. Never order the expensive dish on the menu when someone is giving you a lunch/dinner. If possible ask them to order their choice of food for you;

4. Don’t ask awkward questions like ‘Oh so you aren’t married yet?’ Or ‘Don’t you have kids’ or ‘Why didn’t you buy a house?’ Or why don't you buy a car? For God’s sake it isn’t your problem;

5. Always open the door for the person coming behind you. It doesn’t matter if it is a guy or a girl, senior or junior.  You don’t grow small by treating someone well in public;

6. If you take a taxi with a friend and he/she pays now, try paying next time;

7. Respect different shades of opinions. Remember what's 6 to you will appear 9 to someone facing you. Besides, second opinion is good for an alternative;

8. Never interrupt people talking. Allow them to pour it out. As they say, hear them all and filter them all;

9. If you tease someone, and they don’t seem to enjoy it, stop it and never do it again. It encourages one to do more and it shows how appreciative you're;

10. Say “thank you” when someone is helping you.

11. Praise publicly. Criticize privately;

12. There’s almost never a reason to comment on someone’s weight. Just say, “You look fantastic.” If they want to talk about losing weight, they will;

13. When someone shows you a photo on their phone, don’t swipe left or right. You never know what’s next;

14. If a colleague tells you they have a doctors' appointment, don’t ask what it’s for, just say "I hope you’re okay". Don’t put them in the uncomfortable position of having to tell you their personal illness. If they want you to know, they'll do so without your inquisitiveness;

15. Treat the cleaner with the same respect as the CEO. Nobody is impressed at how rude you can treat someone below you but people will notice if you treat them with respect;

16. If a person is speaking directly to you, staring at your phone is rude;

17. Never give advice until you’re asked;

18. When meeting someone after a long time, unless they want to talk about it, don’t ask them their age and salary;

19. Mind your  business unless anything involves you directly - just stay out of it; 

20. Remove your sunglasses if you are talking to anyone in the street. It is a sign of respect. Moreso, eye contact is as important as your speech; and

21. Never talk about your riches in the midst of the poor. Similarly, don't talk about your children in the midst of the barren.

22.After reading a good message, try to say" Thanks for the message". APPRECIATION remains the easiest way of getting what you don't have.

22/06/2019, 15:51 - Aunt Dora: "You have received a spirit of adoption as sons through which we cry: Abba! Father!" Rom 8:15BC.
Beloved Father: Help us to know You and to recognize how we need You. May Your Spirit move us to always forgive, as You have forgiven us and still forgive our sins everyday.

Dear Lord, what a privilege it is to say "yes" to You each day. Thank You for loving us and forgiving us. Guide us in all our choices today and help us to serve You faithfully. 

We pray to You now, take up our burdens while we are on earth, today, just as You will take them up when we are with You in heaven. By the grace You gave us through the sacrifice of Your only Son, relieve us. May we do Your will while we are alive, just as we will do Your will when we are together with You again, in paradise. 

May we go in peace, with God, and with His other children. May we love one another as Christ taught us. May we follow the example of good men of old, and may God comfort and help us and all who believe in Him, both in this world and in the world which is to come. Amen

*THE DANGER OF CARELESS WORDS!* 

Careless words have destroyed more relationships than any other human vice. The tongue is a knife that can cut another person deeper than any sword. So the next time you're tempted to make a comment at someone else's expense, take just a moment to think before you speak. You may be glad you did.

 Some of us blindly say that as long as what we’re saying is the truth, it’s Ok. But honesty that does not have the best interest of the other person at heart is really a cruel form of selfishness. How do you tell your spouse how you hate fat bellies well knowing that theirs isn't small? 

*JESUS SAID:* 

*_“You can be sure that on the Judgment Day you will have to give account of every useless word you have ever spoken. ~Matthew 12:36GNT_*

 *THEREFORE:* 

*_Let your speech at all times be gracious and pleasant, seasoned with salt, so that you will know how to answer each one [who questions you]. Think Before You Speak. ~Colossians 4:6AMP_*

 *NEVER FORGET:*

 _There are moments in life, when the heart is so full of emotion That if by chance it be shaken, or into its depths like a pebble Drops some careless word, it overflows, and its secret, Spilt on the ground like water, can never be gathered together. ~Henry Wadsworth Longfellow_

 Have a nice day.

02/07/2019, 05:12 - Aunt Dora: POLICE DOGS RECOGNIZE CHRIST IN THE EUCHARIST...

"On the evening of the last day of his October 1995 visit to the United States, John Paul II was scheduled to greet the seminarians at Saint Mary’s Seminary in Baltimore. It had been a very full day that began with a Mass at Oriole Park in Camden Yards, a parade through downtown streets, a visit to the Basilica of the Assumption, the first cathedral in the country, lunch at a local soup kitchen run by Catholic Charities; a prayer service at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in North Baltimore; and finally a quick stop at Saint Mary’s Seminary.

The schedule was tight so the plan was simply to greet the seminarians while they stood outside on the steps. But the Pope made his way through their ranks and into the building. His plan was to first make a visit to the Blessed Sacrament.

When his wishes were made known, security flew into action. They swept the building paying close attention to the chapel where the Pope would be praying. For this purpose highly trained dogs were used to detect any person who might be present.

The dogs are trained to locate survivors in collapsed buildings after earthquakes and other disasters. These highly intelligent and eager dogs quickly went through the halls, offices and classrooms and were then sent to the chapel. They went up and down the aisle, past the pews and finally into the side chapel where the Blessed Sacrament is reserved.

Upon reaching the tabernacle, the dogs sniffed, whined, pointed, and refused to leave, their attention riveted on the tabernacle, until called by their handlers. They were convinced that they discovered someone there.

We Catholics know they were right — they found a real, living Person in the tabernacle!!!"

24/07/2019, 16:13 - John Thomas: A Kampala high court was on Friday thrown into uncontrollable laughter and shouts  in a divorce matter. 
The respondent, a middle aged man  wasn't represented by counsel. He was humble and looked pitiable. 

When asked if he was contesting the divorce, his answer was touching. He said if that is what will bring happiness to the petitioner, he wasn't contesting. 

Next,  were the petitioner's demands for custody of the 3 children and maintenance fee  monthly. Again, the respondent conceeded cheerfully. 

Then the thunderbolt! The respondent made his solatry request. The court was dead quiet. 

Respondent requested for custody of the 22 year busty housemaid. For certainty and unambiguty he pointed at her in court. She stood up for recognition. 

The petitioner went wild in protest. She ignored her counsel and shouted no! no! no!  no way. 

When calm returned, the judge asked the respondent why he wanted custody of the beautiful busty housemaid. 

The respondent replied that he conceeded to all demands of the petitioner to make her happy. Now he's requesting for only one thing to make him happy, yet petitioner has gone wild. 

My Lord, you can see for yourself what I have been going through for the past 27 years of the marriage! Petitioner wants only her happiness, mine not included.. That has been my silent burden. 

The petitioner then charged at the maid and the respondent which drew laughter from the audience. The court was forced into recess to talk to the parties in chamber.

What should My Lord do in your esteemed opinion???

In this new month we shall ascend into new realms of power and authority and access new dimensions of divine revelation in the name of Jesus. We shall operate under the new anointing, and we shall not backslide or look back to our old ways. Everything that pertains to our lives and godliness and everything prepared for us before the foundations of the world must be released in it's correct time and season. We declare that there shall be no delays, no set backs, no hold ups. The light of Your word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path; we shall not stumble or fall! August shall yield for us in the name of Jesus Christ. Thank You for the trials and challenges that we faced in the month of July. They have preserved us, built up our characters, given us a hope. Thank You for the plans You have for us, they are for our good; to give us a future and a hope. We are created for greatness and we shall walk in our purpose. We shall not relent until we see Your glory. We are strong in You and in the power of Your might. We are blessed, You are our refuge and shield. We declare we shall see Your goodness in the land of the leaving. New cycles of victory, success and prosperity will replace old cycles of failure, poverty and death in our lives in the name of Jesus. Our expectations will not be cut off, we surrender this month of August to You Lord. Have Your way in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen

09/08/2019, 22:52 - Aunt Dora: *WHAT IS THE BLESSED SACRAMENT❗❗❗*
An exorcist priest from Canada gave a talk in which he explained * the importance of adoring the Blessed Sacrament * for at least one hour a week.
And for people who suffer from strong illnesses or have problems with some of their family members, he said that going to worship for half an hour or an hour a day, not only cure; but it transforms everything. It is the maximum. The priest also gave some guidelines on how to do the adoration ...
*Example:*
* The first 15 minutes * go before Jesus in the Eucharist, and tell Him that you love Him and that you want to allow yourself  to be loved by Him.
* The next 15 minutes * Thank Him for everything:
For life
For family
For what we have to eat
For work or business
For the water we have to bathe. Etc...
Many, he said, no longer give thanks because we do not value what we have, but we always look at what we do not have.
* After do 15 min of reparation *
Repairing and delivering of our relatives who do not know Him do not love Him ...
Reparation for the terrible things that are happening in the world: Abortions, idolatries, massacres, adulteries, etc ...
*And use the last 15 minutes to make  requests*
He mentioned that he gave the 15 minute times as a guide, but it does not necessarily have to be those times.
He also said that whoever has a disease like cancer, if he goes to the Blessed Sacrament to do adoration, does not lose weight, does not lose his hair, or feel strong pain. He said that from an exposed Blessed Sacrament Jesus' rays are coming out and people get healed and delivered.
* If you want, you can Share this * ... So that everyone knows the importance of Adoration to the Most Blessed Sacrament *

12/08/2019, 06:03 - Anna Christine: Ehhh when you put the percentage to it, sounds more fatal. She should have hired a dr. and obtained a proper clinic status after the requirements were fulfilled. Am sure ahe had funds for it. Then again, other factors have not been looked into here like state of children arrival, availability of funds for the parents to take the children to hospital, availability of a hospital near by etc the cases might have been hopeless to start with...but its an eye opener banange...we should look out for those practise certificates in Dr.s offices. They are usually displayed

24/08/2019, 19:03 - Aunt Dora: Where did Bad Black go? Where did SK Mbuga go? Where did Mike Ezra go? Where did Amama Mbabazi go? I have not lived for a very long time, but I have seen things change.

I have seen men who would 'kujooga' this country sink into oblivion. Maybe it is really true, we all just have our 15 minutes of fame and they soon pass.

When I had just joined Facebook, the celebs of those days were Henry Jr Maks, Divine Marley, General Sweetman. Today no one even remembers them.

Who did not witness the days when WBS TV was the thing? We even had an anthem; 'WBS eyange...tv station esinga...abiiri mutaano ku TV 📺 yo...WBS etusse." People where is WBS now?

What happened to Barbara Yata? Do you people even remember that name? What about PAM Awards? Ragga Dee even sang a song displaying all his awards.

It is funny, we just see these things and never learn from them. Doreen Kabareebe was the talk of the town. Today, hardly anyone can recognize her if she walked by. 

Just because you are having your 15 minutes of fame should not get to your head. Your minutes too shall pass.

I have seen girls that every man yearned for become girls that no man notices. I have seen men who had nothing become something. Life keeps changing its house. Today it may be in your house, it may leave tomorrow.

Just because you have made some little money, and invested in your rentals should not make you think you have arrived. I have seen men sell off everything they had and return to zero. Today's gold is tomorrow's copper.

Do you remember when the mobile phone had just become popular in this country? What happened? 

Lesson in all this, just be humble. Don't let success get to your head and don't look down on anyone who is not having it yet well.

If you have a job, reach out and try to get your friends into jobs. Who knows? If you have money, take off some of it and help a friend or relative. Karma is a real bitch. 

Today you may be on top, tomorrow you could be totally nothing. One of the books that changed my life were Nassim Taleb's Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness.

Life is very random. Yet people keep thinking it is all about their might, their intelligence. How foolish of them!!! Today you are walking all healthy, tomorrow you can wake up to a terminal illness diagnosis. And that will instantly alter your life. Life can change in split seconds. I have seen destinies change in seconds. All of a sudden, the key person of a family, club, group or organization dies and it’s  back to zero, back to eating crumbs, no ideas or principles🤷🏿‍♀🤷🏿‍♀

That's why I laugh at people when they get some fame, some little money and become stupidly arrogant. Many more like you have come, many more like you have have gone.

Those of us who were on Myspace remember the celebs of Myspace. Now where is Myspace today? Where is Yahoo? 

I can go on and on. Too many examples. So when you get your 15 minutes of fame, use them wisely. And always remember, what goes around comes around. Even Fooda was a hit song....

The Baganda say; 'N'ebiibimba bbika.." 
Don't despise anyone.
Be humble.

30/08/2019, 18:38 - Joanna: *Moving out of the Comfort Zone*

Once there was a king who received a gift of two magnificent falcons. They were peregrine falcons, the most beautiful birds he had ever seen. He gave the precious birds to his head falconer to be trained.

Months passed, and one day the head falconer informed the king that though one of the falcons was flying majestically, soaring high in the sky, the other bird had not moved from its branch since the day it had arrived.

The king summoned healers and sorcerers from all the land to tend to the falcon, but no one could make the bird fly.

He presented the task to the member of his court, but the next day, the king saw through the palace window that the bird had still not moved from its perch.

Having tried everything else, the king thought to himself, “May be I need someone more familiar with the countryside to understand the nature of this problem.” So he cried out to his court, “Go and get a farmer.”

In the morning, the king was thrilled to see the falcon soaring high above the palace gardens. He said to his court, “Bring me the doer of this miracle.”

The court quickly located the farmer, who came and stood before the king. The king asked him, “How did you make the falcon fly?”

With his head bowed, the farmer said to the king, “It was very easy, your highness. I simply cut the branch where the bird was sitting.”

LESSON:
We are all made to fly — to realize our incredible potential as human beings. But at times we sit on our branches, clinging to the things that are familiar to us. 
The possibilities are endless, but for most of us, they remain undiscovered. We conform to the familiar, the comfortable, and the mundane. So for the most part, our lives are mediocre instead of exciting, thrilling and fulfilling. Let us learn to destroy the branch of fear we cling to and free ourselves to the glory of flight!

20/09/2019, 19:22 - Joanna: Did you know that you can use raw papaya(paw paw) to heal ulcers,  constipation,  acid reflux,  treat diabetes  ,unblock fallopain tubes ,clear scar tissues and adhensions, and also loose weight. 

In this article,  we shall be looking at healing very bad ulcers, acid reflux,  tumors(both cancerous and non)  in the stomach and intestines, constipation.

What you will need for the case of severe ulcers and tumors 
- raw pawpaw - 1 medium size
- aloe vera  gel- 2 tablespoons 
- black seeds- 1 teaspoon 
- soursop- 1 teaspoon 
- Bermuda grass powder - 1 teaspoon ( also good for PCOs, UTIs and STIs) 
-dandelion - 1 teaspoon 

How to prepare 
Get a medium size raw papaya wash it very well and slice off it's bottom to reveal  a hole-like inside. 

Then staff the raw pawpaw with all or some of the above mentioned herbs. 

Add hot water into the pawpaw 

Now cover the staffed paw paw and allow the content to brew over night. 

Strain the content and keep in an air tight container. 

Then take 1/4 glass of the content  3 times a day at least 30 minutes before meals.

Do this for 1 month to have the ulcers disappear. 

You may add honey to improve  taste. 

Best of luck to all who wish to try. 

Let food be thy medicine.

He left us 04 statements:
(1) Nothing is eternal in this world, not even our problems.
(2) I like to walk in the rain, because no one can see my tears.
(3) The most wasted day in life is the day we do not laugh.
(4) The six best doctors in the world ....
1. Sun,
2. Rest,
3. Exercise,
4. Diet,
5. Self-esteem
6. Friends.
Keep them at all stages of your life and enjoy a healthy life ...
If you see the moon You will see the beauty of God .....
If you see the sun You will see the power of God ...
If you see the mirror, you will see the best creation of God.
So, believe it.
We are all tourists, God is our travel agent who has already fixed our itineraries, reservations and destinations ... Trust Him and enjoy the LIFE
Life is just a trip!
Live today !!!!
Share with people who are important to you ...
_________*Life*__________
To understand it, you have to visit these 3 places:
- the Hospital 🏥
- The Prison 🏫
- The Cemetery 🌑
At the hospital, you will understand that nothing is more beautiful than health.
In Prison, you will see that liberty is the most precious thing.
- In the cemetery you will realize that life is worthless, the ground on which we walk today will be our roof tomorrow. Let us make the effort to remain humble by having the fear of God and the respect of our neighbor.

31/10/2019, 20:39 - John Thomas: Guys please be #warned. This is too sad 😭😭😭😭.

Yesterday i got home past midnight very late after a certain function in Namasuba😥. And because i did not have any other means of transport i decided to use a boda boda despite being warned by my friend not to.

I insisted and boarded this boda boda. On my way home i started getting suspicious and scared at how this boda boda guy was staring at me strangely through his side mirror.

We finally reached my destination at Bunamwaya and got off the boda boda, i reached for my pass and handed 10k to him and asked him to keep the change as well so that he could atleast spare my life.

I then immediately turned to walk away to my house and this is where my #Nightmare begun. The guy started following me. I moved faster and the guy got the speed too .....

I knew this was trouble so i started running to the opposite direction and he chased me. At that time i felt so helpless because i knew no one would come to my rescue since it was so late in the night.

I got so tired at a certain point and decided to face this guy. He grabbed my hand and he softly said this to me, "Please give me my #helmet",  its at that time that i realised i was still wearing his helmet. 

Am now seated in my sitting room watching a movie. Good day!

12/11/2019, 23:43 - Aunt Dora: MY LIFE LESSONS  BY . HON.ODONGA OTTO MP UGANDA 
Thanks for all birthday wishes.I  was told by my late father James otto that i was born on 11th November 1977 a date i doubt firstly  because my mum was killed by karimojong cattle rustlers in 1987 she could have known the dates better,secondly my elder brother David also told me that my father told him  the same date as his birthday.it doesn't matter, years move in a linear manner it doesnt move in a  round manner for a birthday to repeat it self,its just human codification for ease of reference in passports, documents etc but please read my story###longpost warning:####
My chilhood was the most difficult that i think no one reading this post has  ever gine through a similar experience those who knew me from under fiteen years can testify.
My father separated with my mother at the time i was born that is why my mother called me :"odonga" meaning let him remain with me.
Secondly my father made a decision i term the worst to take me with him to my step mother  at the time of divorce.

LESSON 1:mothers die with your child dont ever allow your child to grow up with step mother the world would rather end.

My Dad got arrested by the UPC goverment in 1980/1 and spent 5 years in luzira prison.I was left with a step mother who  is still alive.My late  mother did not know my  whereabouts  and even if she did she probably had no authority over my custody.
During those 5 years of dad being in prison i visited hell on earth,My eldest brother Tadeo went to boarding school negri primary my second bother david was "deported" to the village and he is a P.7 dropout

LESSON 2 :see what education  has done it has  now created two seperate  biengs from the same womb  give education your best it replaces an empty head 

I remained alone to a young step mother about 27 years  she was a teacher .I would be locked in a room from morning to evening as there was no one to look after me,with one meal for the day kept in the room. 
Barely 5 years occasionally i would climb through the vents to see my friends playing in the compound the feeling still sends a chill down my spine.
Needless to say the room (prison) was not self contained  she would return to get the room in a mess and a stick would do the cleaning.
Years I later on 1984 i  joined P.1 in negri primary,i was about 7 years that was the first and last memorable time in my life i saw my late  mother. she took advantage of the visitation to visit her son whi she had not seen  in years who now in a boarding school from."prison".She was tall in brown outfit it was called "maxi" then. she lifted me high and i gave her a long list of things to bring on the next visition ,little did i know it was the last time i was seeing her .

LESSON 3 :readers in life when hugging a dear one please bear in mind it may be the last time ,give it your best .

uncle paul years later came and told my mother was dead i was not bothered because i had not bonded with her i continued playing, she died of bullet wounds.
 
My formative years from P.4 to S.4 was the worst superintended by my step mother, extreme use of mannual labour as a means of tourture in the name of hard work ;each one head a drum of water to fill before going to school,our mornings would begin at 5am by 7 am each ones 200liters drum is to be full daily before going to school and  the body is too tired for school.

Digging weekends 7am to 7pm at stepmothers home was routine   we would do close to what a tractor could do in day.Passers by in the morning would wonder in the evening how 3 peoples(brothers could do this).
Rationing food,stravation ,washing plates ,pounding,washing house walls,washing her clothes and those of all her sisters who had migrated permanently to our home, was on the daily menu.As they sat a watched movies.

LESSON 4, Dont let visitors at your home turn your own children into slaves.

My luck came when i got a vocation to join a seminary that had no option of day schooling,my brothers where not allowed in boardong school .And that finally made a difference in our eventual academic performance.
I remember my stepmother calling my elder brother at 8am to slash the compound yet that was the day he was sitting for national UCE examinations,he had already  fetched his morning  rountine 200litre  drum of water,i had to join him to slash the compound non stop for upto 15  minutes to exam time then he had to run 8kms to school to catch up with exam time.He was late and didnt do we...he later told he just wrote his name and sat since it was chemistry he hated.

LESSON 5 ,don't use work as a punishement or a torture tool.

I  completed O,level,A lelvel joined Univesity and came out with a degree in social sciences .my graduation was not attended by any of my parents,i walked to freedom square typical.of lumumba hall courage and got my degree there was not voice to ululate for me as the read my name ,i stood behind with no peny in my pocket, and a kind old man Mr. Odida Francis got me a gown  took for lunch at tick hotel kawempe.I enjoyed the chips and chicken .Now the whole world was ahead of me.  I later took my degree home to my father and stepmother.My stepmother who also had 5  children  was never happy for me having attained a degree.My degree created more unease home as i waited for a job.I was later told by my stepmother that i was to help in home chores of collect residues of food from a girls  secondary  school Sacred heart to feed the pigs ,secondly that I was to cut grass to feed the friesian cows.
Beacuse i did not want to disapoint my Dad who had already leactured me on Pope John paul II missive towards work ,i opted to secretly get a teaching job at atiak technical that was displaced in gulu town ,to teach English and use the proceeds to hire young boys to do the dirty job of delivering the pig food.Word reached home of my evasive and nagative attitude to work and there was a bigger conference than the 1884 berlin conference or the 1914 Versailles peace traeaty  that i had just studied at university called at home .It was resolved i stop teaching and concentrate on feeding the animals 
I continied teaching secretly.

LESSON 6 men when you are in a second marriage or polygamous marriage beware  and warn yourself that love for the children may follow the  love for their mother,for the woman you love most  you will tend to  love her children more  "mutatus mutandi "..BEWARE.

I later started doing the job of collecting pig food,at wee hours cutting grass for  cows in distant locations.This did not help.In life  some people can never change and can't be amused of their objective is harm another meeting was called over this new developements of me cutting graas from far and  rules changed and they started designating places that i should cut grass.
That the issue was to deal with  was pride of having a degree and not mere cutting grass or collecting pig food.For me i was obtaining the desired results others where looking at the means.
The next morning my step mother told me there was good grass at the current acholi inn hotel and i was told to go and cut grass there, mind you this was a  ground where few graduates  sat and analysed global trends,the pressure was building on me.Secondly that the food at lunch time at girls schools was more so she had  talked to a staff that i should be there at 12noon and pick food as girls dropped  since there was competition for the same food by others.
Her children where much younger and in primary and secondary school and would have been the best for such jobs in my opinion.my options where getting limited.
I remembered Dr.Simba in a political science class wondering ; what would the importance of education be to those at home if graduates are not seen as role models.
I gathered courage and told my step mother two things one,please let your children do it,secondly even if the pigs food would make the pigs grow like a ballon being blown I AM NOT GOING

LESSON 7 when life seem empty when you feel there is no point going push a little if nothing changes you have to make a decision.

My stepmother broke down in tears shouting that i had abused i hurried to the house before my Dad could drop home for lunch break that would be bad i knew if he found me home.
I packed my things in a kavera polythine bag off through the backyard going to "i dont know where".
I reach town boarded a vehicle to my mothes  clan home,where i was received and felt soo loved for the first tiime in years

LESSON 8:there are times in life you have to learn to make fast decisions, a bad decsion is better than no decision at all.

I later went to the village to visit my cousins and maternal relatives the first time in 22 years of my life what a feeling of joy  and welcome .I broke down in tears to know there where people who loved and cared for me,i met my late  mothers  sister and uncles i had to become a baby and cry abit.I saw my younger sister struggling preparing sorghurm posho for lunch with smoke belowing in the entire grass tatch house i could hardly breath.I ate lunch and asked for a hoe to go digging i knew i had in built capacity to work.She  looked at me in the eyes and said "its dry season"

LESSON 9 :In life no mater the spite ,riducle,hatred,abuses,agrresion towards you,jealousy etc just know you are loved by someone,there are people who love you ,who dont sleep thinking of you so please love yourself don't give up .

I later saw a vacuum being the only graduate in the village i contested for parliamentary elections 6 months after university and deafeated the incumbent  minister of education Hon. Alfred Ogaba and become elected member of parliament aruu county pader district in the year 2000 at 23 years making the record then  of being  the youngest Member of parliament  in uganda.i have never worked any where since in this is my fisrt job.

Todate i have been an MP for 18 years thank God,i have 6 children(4   girls 2 boys) , my first marriage failed . I obtaies a master degree and a another Degree in law i am now an advocate. I live in a comfortable house of my own ,drive and a few businesses, i now employ abot 30 ugandans on full time basis.while In parliament given my childhood memories I choose to speak for the oppressed and would prefer that i be  the last on the list of oppression.I   am very sensitive to my children issues  when  my two older daughters  come to stay with me i keep a watchfull eye.
MEN don't be in bars come home late and think your wife is good to be with her step children hey...she is probably worse than mine.

LESSON 10: Keep your faith ,when there is no room for rationality or reasoning follow your instincts whatever route you take  your God will always be with you.
whichever route you take you will see light at the end of the turnel endure,.. endure ...endure.your sufferings should not be in vain.

42 years down the road,my two elelder brothers just like me  are grappling with life arising from a detented childhood Just like  the prisoners during the french revolution when the bastile prison was broken 11 inmates found in  three  weeks later  went back on their own volition  even when the prison doors where wide  open.They had overstayed in prison and gotten used.we overstayed in oppression.my father died 4 years ago,my stepmother has since become a "catechist"after my fathers death,a catechist with a locked borehole home not accessible to neighbours.Of my 5 step brothers who had  preferential treatment in early chilhood  2 are drivers,one a lawyer,one a chef and one remains unemployed.I reburied my mother 10 years ago.
My story is like of Joseph in Egypt,i rose from grass to grace thank.God.
LESSON 11: The stone the builders have rejected has become the corner house stone,don't mistreat peoples children it will bring misfortunes to yours.
PLEASE SHARE THIS POST I MAY BE A CELEBRITY IN MANY EYES IN UGANDA BUT YOU DONT KNOW WHAT I WENT THROUGH,.... .PEOPLE DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH.... PEOPLE DONT KNOW WHAT YOUR CHILDREN ARE GOING THROUGH.....PEOPLE DONT KNOW WHAT  OTHER CHILDREN ARE GOING THROUGH.
THANKS FOR THE BIRTHDAY WISHES
PLEASE SHARE.....if there are those who think they have problems let then see my story and learn  that success doesnt come easy

16/11/2019, 19:57 - Aunt Dora: *Internationally Renowned Vatican Healing Priest Don Michele Barone with Pope Francis* 

Father Michael Barone, (Don Michele Barone) the great gifted Mystic Priest from Naples, Italy gave a Talk in Dublin, Ireland recently. He has the Charisma of Exorcism, Reading Hearts and can tell if souls are not baptized because he says that they have No Light in their eyes – if not baptized. Amazing Priest!

Father Barone said Children are a great blessing on your House. He said *the evil one tries in every way to invite the Children and Youth of today to offend the Lord.* He said Our Lady asks that we *pray for families because the family is under attack from the evil one who delights in the separation of family and the damage it does to children.* 

He said that in Exorcisms the demons have said that we are creating our families - Man and Man, Woman and Woman. The devil is happy when families are destroyed and torn apart. He said Europe (EU) and its Laws are Blaspheming against God.

He referred to Fatima and mentioned that from 1917 for 100 years Satan would have dominion. He repeated the need for prayer within and for the family. He said that Our Lady stated in Medjugorje that She will finish in Medjugorie what she started in Fatima.

Fr Barone, then referred to The Most Holy Rosary - he said it is a powerful Armour of God. He said the demons have screamed at him during exorcism that the Rosary when prayed is bashing our heads with a hammer. *He said Our Lady of Medjugorje requested 7 Our Fathers 7 Hail Marys and 7 Glory be - to be prayed every day* and She would send Special Blessings from Her Heart and will sustain us in this life. Father emphasized again how the Devil had told him in an Exorcism, that the Rosary is a hammer, bashing him on the head.

He said Our Lady *wants us to Open the Bible every day and read 2 or 3 lines and to Fast on Wednesday and Friday* on Bread and Water. He told us that Our lady said we will receive great graces when we Fast but also we need these graces so much .

He told us that Our Lady had taken two of the Medjugorje seers Vicka (Vishka) and Jakov to Heaven, Purgatory and Hell. In Heaven they saw people dressed in Grey, some in Yellow and some in Red - great happiness and continual worship of God by Angels and the Saints (people) there, *Purgatory was a great big place full of Mist and Souls longing for God - WAITING for our Prayers to Help THEM.* Hell was a huge Place of Fire with screaming half human, half animal beings. He told us that Our Lady said these souls wanted to be here.

He spoke about the *need for us to wear on our person Holy Medals, Crucifixes, Scapulars, Rosaries etc.* To wear such Religious Sacramentals is so important because the Devil knows and he sees us wearing them – he will not dare approach us.

Father spoke about the Spiritual Benefits of Holy Water, Blessed Salt and Blessed Oil. *He said we should bless every room in our house every week with Holy Water and make the Sign of the Cross in every room.* He told us, if we put a drop of Holy Water into another Container of Water that this Water will become Holy Water. This Blessing of Houses will help people who are drinking too much or taking drugs. He said that Drugs and Drink are Satan’s Chosen Food which drives people into madness and serious sin including crimes. Another Spiritual Benefit of Blessing your House, is that it can prevent sufferings in your family and again it keeps the spirit of evil away.

He said the demons will do anything to keep you away from God and the Holy Mass. The Holy Mass will take away all temptations.

Father said that he met recently with Pope Francis. The Pope told him we are living in the End Times and this is the reign of Satan. The Pope asked us to pray for Mercy. He said that we must try to be faithful to God and Pray for the Pope. He said that in August 2014, Our Lady called the Pope “Her Most Beloved Pope”. He added, that the 7th secret of Medjugorje has been reduced in impact because God has heard peoples’ prayers

Father said that we should make the Sign of the Cross 3 times every day over any parts of our person that is sick, like Cancer Tumors etc. He told us that Food we buy could be contaminated by evil which can cause cancer. He said we should use Blessed Oil and Salt on our Food.  

 *If inspired so many more will be enlightened by these graces!*

19/11/2019, 20:12 - Aunt Dora: French President Emmanuel Macron said: *"With a family that has seven, eight children in Africa, even if you invest billions, nothing will change, because the challenge of Africa is civilizational".* The Guinean sociologist Amadou Douno, a professor at the Ahmadou-Dieng University of Conakry, answers him.
*"Africans do not need your debauchery civilization. Because with your civilization: a man can sleep with a man; a woman can sleep with a woman; a single president can have two mistresses at a time; a woman can sleep with her dog; a child can insult his father and mother without problem; a child can imprison his parents."*
*"With your civilization, when parents are getting older, they are taken to the retirement home, and finally, with your civilization, a young man can live with a woman who is his mother's age or his grandma without problem. Your case is a perfect illustration!* *Africans have no civilization lesson to receive from people like you!* *Africa is by far the richest continent in the world with its enormous mineral wealth. What is delaying this continent is the large-scale pillage of its resources by the great powers, France in the lead!”* *"All the misery of Africa comes from this country that realizes its ambitions on the backs of Africans, with the complicity of these traitors who do not hesitate to sacrifice entire generations by delivering their countries to the former colonizing power.* *They entrust all the key sectors of their economies to France. In reality, they lead the political strategy or vision desired by the former settler.* *This contributes to driving their populations into misery and extreme poverty.* *This is the cause of coups d'état, civil wars, genocides, famines, with despots at the head of these countries that are kept in power by France, because it meets all their requirements!"*
*"France is nothing without Africa! The day the African countries turn their backs on France, this country will plunge into chaos! As long as African countries do not abandon this domination of the former colonial power, by taking charge of their own destiny, as the Asian countries have done, it will be very difficult for them to get out of the abyss.* *The challenge for Africa is to get rid of France. Because the latter is not the solution to its underdevelopment, it is at the heart of the problem!*

26/11/2019, 08:22 - Bengie: Hi Everyone 
Good morning 
There’s a suggestion to open up a Savings account or scheme for the people on this group 
We can come up with figure that’s okay or comfortable for everyone maybe 15k each month ! 
Open in a bank with three to four signatories! 
Yay or nah ?
26/11/2019, 08:25 - Lena: Good morning, yay!
26/11/2019, 08:26 - Patsy: 🙋🏾‍♀yeey
26/11/2019, 08:27 - Fina: Yay
26/11/2019, 08:31 - Lena: I'm a yay!🙋
26/11/2019, 08:43 - Elsie Mulo: Hey ....yay
26/11/2019, 08:44 - Irene Nakalembe: Yay in
26/11/2019, 08:46 - Adela Mulo: #metooalso
26/11/2019, 08:47 - Tina, Kerbi: Yay
26/11/2019, 08:54 - Bengie: Suggestions on the bank and figure are welcome 
‘S 15k okay oba we do 20k ?
26/11/2019, 08:54 - Bengie: @256788040993 are you in ? Okay with figure ? @ Livia ??
26/11/2019, 08:55 - Irene Nakalembe: First of all decide what is the purpose of the savings what is the goal for saving how many people will want to be a part of if .how long to accomplish that goal. Then we work backworks divide goal time by people interested and amount needed to decide how much each one should pay
26/11/2019, 08:56 - Irene Nakalembe: Only a suggestion
26/11/2019, 08:58 - Fina: The idea came up after we realized the family has many functions and they are still many to come up in the future. We are many cousins and a Sacco would be a good idea. But yes, collectively let’s decide the goals
26/11/2019, 09:00 - Bengie: Can be for investments too if we go some years with out functions! 
Insurance companies have schemes that are actually good ! And profiting you save in a bank and get on scheme with an insurance and make a very small profit every month ! 
More suggestions are welcome 
We can draft a constitution or sthg !
26/11/2019, 09:03 - John Thomas: 👍🏽
26/11/2019, 09:04 - Joanna: I spoke to aunt Olivia about 3 months ago and also suggested that we open up an investment club account with dfcu. You'd all have access to the account by the app and know every members contribution. Youd know the balance on the account and any withdraw.  We can schedule club meetings on the app and reminders. Youd get message alerts if any borrowing was required by individual members if the constitution allowed. So first things first, we need to decide on a club name, I'll help get it registered, we need to have a meeting and agree on the constitution because it has many people in it and we need its goals clear and handling of funds.
26/11/2019, 09:04 - Joanna: So for me I have sold as a banker🤪❤
26/11/2019, 09:05 - Joanna: When can we meet and conclude this.
26/11/2019, 09:05 - Joanna: Yay
26/11/2019, 09:05 - Irene Nakalembe: We can watsapp meet
26/11/2019, 09:05 - Joanna: I'd also help with the account opening process if it's okay.
26/11/2019, 09:06 - Joanna: We need to decide on the constitution
26/11/2019, 09:06 - Joanna: But first what's the Investment Club name?
26/11/2019, 09:07 - Bengie: Some people haven’t yet responsed ! 
Especially the two little babies on this forum Livia and Thomas !
26/11/2019, 09:07 - Joanna: Oba confirm they have data🤦🏾‍♀🤩💐 Livia might be in class
26/11/2019, 09:12 - Tina, Kerbi: 😅
26/11/2019, 09:13 - Tina, Kerbi: Good idea though. Why not grow wealth within family....#Indianstyle
26/11/2019, 09:13 - Joanna: What do you mean
26/11/2019, 09:16 - Tina, Kerbi: DFCU has an investment club service
26/11/2019, 09:26 - Joanna: India style how love
26/11/2019, 09:31 - Joanna: Objectives of the club in the constitution need to be agreed upon however, some of the common ones include.
26/11/2019, 09:32 - Joanna: 1. To mobilize savings by way of a monthly contribution and basically to encourage members to raise funds for savings in every possible way.
26/11/2019, 09:34 - Joanna: 2. Advance loans to members for productive purposes and to charge interest at rates agreed upon by members as laid out.
26/11/2019, 09:36 - Joanna: 3. To invest club funds as decided upon by members in such ways that are financially profitable ...eg buildings and real estate, habitat, financial inclusion, stock markets, insurance options environment and related ventures as agreed upon by member
26/11/2019, 09:36 - Joanna: s
26/11/2019, 09:37 - Joanna: 4. Agree dividends based on year earnings etc etc
26/11/2019, 09:37 - Joanna: 5. Mobilise family mutual funds for functions etc as agreed
26/11/2019, 09:38 - Joanna: Kwegamba we need to articulate the objectives as the above are just samples.
26/11/2019, 09:39 - Joanna: 6. Political interference shall be kept out of the investment club but members of all political leanings can be members if they fulfill qualifications for membership
26/11/2019, 09:39 - Joanna: Thomas is typing hi Thomas😊
26/11/2019, 09:40 - TJ Musiitwa: I'm good with this....
26/11/2019, 09:40 - TJ Musiitwa: Hi
26/11/2019, 09:41 - TJ Musiitwa: My suggestion is that while @256772659191 has sold us the perspective...self as promotion there...
It would be good to do thorough research on the banks we have today and see which gives the highest return of investment savings
26/11/2019, 09:42 - TJ Musiitwa: Try to balance between high investment returns and flexibility of access for group members
26/11/2019, 09:43 - TJ Musiitwa: I do recall reading in a newspaper article that *GT bank* offered the highest savings return amongst all banks
26/11/2019, 09:43 - TJ Musiitwa: So I just think that should be a consideration
26/11/2019, 09:48 - Joanna: So then there is the part of membership
26/11/2019, 09:51 - Joanna: Membership in the  club shall be open to such people as have these qualifications:...(We need to be clear, who is in this, and also its if we have minors - under 18, their paros will represent them
26/11/2019, 09:51 - Joanna: Okay what we are formulating are bi-laws
26/11/2019, 09:51 - Joanna: Also does membership cease?  We can agree what stays what goes eg Membership shall cease when a member;
1)	Dies 
2)	Is expelled from the investment club by the Annual General Meeting.
3)	Is declared an undischarged bankrupt or a criminal under the Law
4)	When they have been repaid all the amount standing to their credit as members.
5)	Fails to pay the required monthly contributions. If you take 3 months without pay, then you will leave the investment club or something
6)	Those exiting will forfeit 10% of their savings with the group. (haha...)
26/11/2019, 09:51 - Joanna: It doesn't have to be that strict but those are just examples.
26/11/2019, 09:51 - Joanna: So all you have to do is tell me what you are leaving and what you're taking then I can create the bi-laws/constitution and we agree.
26/11/2019, 09:51 - Joanna: I fully support the idea of looking around for banks and return on savings. Lets have some volunteers for the bank search.  Me I am a bank trotter and have accounts across.  Only thing is I'd like some comfort around the money and that's why I suggested dfcu because of the dfcu Bank App where we all get to see whats going on with the funds.
26/11/2019, 09:55 - Bengie: Joan why don’t we open a joint savings account first bse as a group we will have to incur registration costs ! Or when ready to invest then we we can register as a club or company 
Just a suggestion !
26/11/2019, 09:56 - Joanna: I think I responded to it up there. Ill handle registration
26/11/2019, 09:56 - Joanna: Because joint accounts leave us not knowing and seeing whats going on with our money
26/11/2019, 09:57 - Joanna: group accounts allow for transparency if infact we have more than 2 people on them
26/11/2019, 09:58 - TJ Musiitwa: Okay so you got dfcu, @256779050344 can help with KCB
@256777140761 help with housing finance
@256772554719 with Orient
@256777029961 with Standard Chartered...
Any other bankers I've forgotten about,..
Then the rest we can work from there
26/11/2019, 09:59 - Joanna: Patsy can do Centenary did she move to Housing Finance
26/11/2019, 09:59 - TJ Musiitwa: Right sorry Centenary
26/11/2019, 09:59 - Bengie: Ohh okay !!
26/11/2019, 09:59 - Bengie: Thank you !
26/11/2019, 10:00 - TJ Musiitwa: I'll be in town today I'll try to ask about UBA
26/11/2019, 10:01 - Bengie: As we wait for the Rest to Respond! Mwebare! 
Have a beautiful day y’ll 🤗🤗
26/11/2019, 10:03 - Patsy: still with centenary bank TJ,
26/11/2019, 10:04 - Patsy: Pauline is with Stanbic
26/11/2019, 10:04 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha yeah yeah I know confused them because of their yellow colours
26/11/2019, 10:04 - TJ Musiitwa: Eyy least I know it's a bank
26/11/2019, 10:07 - Joanna: For proper advice as a banker, let me share with you two things.
26/11/2019, 10:07 - Joanna: Banks with group accounts
26/11/2019, 10:07 - Joanna: Banks with investment club accounts
26/11/2019, 10:08 - Lena: Oh wow you got 2 banks wrong
26/11/2019, 10:08 - Joanna: Group accounts incur unfavourable conditions almost like Corporate company accounts and can deplete your savings in the process. While investment club accounts and sacco accounts take into consideration the need for you to save and invest and therefore carry some incentives.
26/11/2019, 10:08 - Lena: Thomas I can get you UBA dont worry
26/11/2019, 10:10 - Patsy: seconded on wat She sed!, and also investment club accounts dnt incurr monthly charges, so u just put money and put money and put money.....
26/11/2019, 10:11 - Joanna: When you make inquiries please focus more on the sacco and investment accounts eg Centenary, Equity...
26/11/2019, 10:15 - Lena: O.k great
26/11/2019, 10:16 - TJ Musiitwa: <Media omitted>
26/11/2019, 10:18 - TJ Musiitwa: Uganda's banking sector is effectively very competitive so many choices🤷🏾‍♂
26/11/2019, 10:25 - Joanna: Banks for investment clubs are Housing Finance, Centenary, Equity, Barclays, Bank of Africa, CBA and Tropical Bank. Please focus on those. I have worked for Stanbic and Standard Chartered and whereas Standard Chartered does not have, Stanbic Pauline will advise what they came up with for Saccos as I was leaving because we'd put a request forward. By then, they didn't have for investment clubs.
26/11/2019, 10:39 - Joanna: Equity Bank website shows - free account opening, no minimum balance, no monthly fees, free cheque book of 25 leaves, free online statements, free financial literacy training, an equity ordinary account for individual members Requirements include minutes from members and the resolution, a copy of the investment club constitution , national ids /passport and proof of residence.      On the side they have an Ezzy Club solution called Eazzy chama for online access for the investment club to help with tracing member contributions, they can monitor withdrawals and get reports .
26/11/2019, 10:40 - Ben: Am in for the investment club
26/11/2019, 10:41 - Ben: Can we keep it simple though..  Options sometimes can be confusing..  Let's go with DFCU,  they have the online banking option for monitoring and we have someone on the inside..
26/11/2019, 10:45 - Bengie: Am for Dfcu too we have someone  there 😉 banyankole style they go were their people are !

*CANADIAN MAYOR REFUSES TO REMOVE PORK FROM SCHOOL CANTEEN MENU* and EXPLAINS WHY

Muslim parents demanded the abolition of pork in all the school canteens of a Montreal suburb. The mayor of the Montreal suburb of Dorval has refused, and the town-clerk sent a note to all parents to explain why. Here's that note:

“Muslims must understand that they have to adapt to Canada and Quebec, its customs, its traditions, its way of life, because that's where they chose to immigrate.

“They must understand that they have to integrate and learn to live in Quebec.

“They must understand that it is for them to change their lifestyle, not  the Canadians who so generously welcomed them.

“They must understand that Canadians are neither racist nor xenophobic, they accepted many immigrants before Muslims (whereas the reverse is not true, in that Muslim states do not accept non-Muslim immigrants).

“That no more than other nations, Canadians are not willing to give up their identity, their culture.

“And if Canada is a land of welcome, it's not the Mayor of Dorval who welcomes foreigners, but the Canadian-Quebecois people as a whole.

“Finally, they must understand that in Canada (Quebec) with its Judeo-Christian roots, Christmas trees, churches and religious festivals, religion must remain in the private domain.
The municipality of Dorval was right to refuse any concessions to Islam and Sharia.

“For Muslims who disagree with secularism and do not feel comfortable in Canada, there are 57 beautiful Muslim countries in the world, most of them under-populated and ready to receive them with open halal arms in accordance with Sharia.

“If you left your country for Canada, and not for other Muslim countries, it is because you have considered that life is better in Canada than elsewhere.

“Ask yourself the question, just once, “Why is it better here in Canada than where you come from?” 'A canteen with pork' is part of the answer.”

13/12/2019, 02:35 - Aunt Dora: Dr. Gupta says,  No one must die of cancer except out of carelessness;  (1). First step is to stop all sugar intake, without sugar in your body, cancer cell would die a natural death. (2). Second step is to blend a whole lemon fruit with a cup of hot water and drink it for about 1-3 months first thing before food and cancer would disappear, research by Maryland College of Medicine says, it's 1000 times better than chemotherapy. (3). Third step is to drink 3 spoonfuls of organic coconut oil, morning and night and cancer would disappear, you can choose any of the two therapies after avoiding sugar. Ignorance  is no excuse; I have been sharing this information for over 5 years. Let everyone around you know.God bless.
