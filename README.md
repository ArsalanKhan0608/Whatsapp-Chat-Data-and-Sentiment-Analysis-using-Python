# Whatsapp-Chat-Data-and-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Python
WhatsApp is one of the most used messenger applications today with more than 2 billion users worldwide. It was found that more than 65 billion messages are sent on WhatsApp daily, so we can use WhatsApp chat for analyzing our chat with a friend, customer, or a group of people.
